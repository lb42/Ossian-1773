 <div type="preface">
  <head>PREFACE.</head>
  <p> <hi rend="smallcaps">Without</hi> encreaſing his genius, the Author may have improved his language,
   in the eleven years, that the following poems have been in the hands of the public. Errors in
   diction might have been committed at twenty-four, which the experience of a riper age may remove;
   and ſome exuberances in imagery may be reſtrained, with advantage, by a degree of judgment
   acquired in the progreſs of time. Impreſſed with this opinion, he ran over the whole with
   attention and accuracy ; and, he hopes, he has brought the work to a ſtate of correctneſs, which
   will preclude all future improvements.</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> eagerneſs, with which theſe Poems have been received abroad, are a
   recompence for the coldneſs with which a few have affected to treat them at home. All the polite
   nations of Europe have transferred them into their 
   <pb xml:id="P73100004" facs="../img/1773-023.pbm"/>
    reſpective languages; and they ſpeak of him, who brought them to light, in
   terms that might flatter the vanity of one fond of fame. In a convenient indifference for a
   literary reputation, the Author hears praiſe without being elevated, and ribaldry, without being
   depreſſed. He has frequently ſeen the firſt beſtowed too precipitately; and the latter is ſo
   faithleſs to its purpoſe, that it is often the only index to merit in the preſent age.</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Though</hi> the taſte, which defines genius, by the points of the compaſs, is a
   ſubject fit for mirth in itſelf, it is often a ſerious matter in the ſale of a work. When rivers
   define the limits of abilities, as well as the boundaries of countries, a Writer may meaſure his
   ſucceſs, by the latitude under which he was born. It was to avoid a part of this inconvenience,
   that the Author is ſaid, by ſome, who ſpeak without any authority, to have aſcribed his own
   productions to another name. If this was the caſe, he was but young in the art of deception. When
   he placed the poet in 
   <pb xml:id="P73100005" facs="../img/1773-026.pbm"/>
    antiquity, the Tranſlator ſhould have been born on this ſide of the
   Tweed.</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">These</hi> obſervations regard only the frivolous in matters of literature;
   theſe, however, form a majority in every age and nation. In this country, men of genuine taſte
   abound ; but their ſtill voice is drowned in the clamours of a multitude, who judge by faſhion of
   poetry, as of dreſs. The truth is, to judge aright requires almoſt as much genius as to write
   well; and good critics are as rare as great poets. Though two hundred thouſand Romans ſtood up,
   when Virgil came into the Theatre, Varius only could correct the Æneid. He that obtains fame muſt
   receive it through mere faſhion; and gratify his vanity with the applauſe of men, of whoſe
   judgment he cannot approve.</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> following Poems, it muſt be confeſſed, are more calculated to pleaſe
   perſons of exquiſite feelings of heart, than thoſe who receive all their impreſſions by the ear.
   The novelty of cadence, in what is called a proſe verſion, tho' 
   <pb xml:id="P73100006" facs="../img/1773-029.pbm"/>
    not deſtitute of harmony, will not to common readers ſupply the abſence of
   the frequent returns of rhime. This was the opinion of the Writer himſelf, tho' he yielded to the
   judgment of others, in a mode, which preſented freedom and dignity of expreſſion, inſtead of
   fetters, which cramp the thought, whilſt the harmony of language is preſerved. His intention was
   to publiſh in verſe. The making of poetry, like any other handicraft, may be learned by induſtry;
   and he had ſerved his apprenticeſhip, though in ſecret, to the muſes,</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> is, however, doubtful, whether the harmony which theſe poems might derive
   from rhime, even in much better hands than thoſe of the tranſlator, could atone for the
   ſimplicity and energy, which they would loſe. The determination of this point ſhall be left to
   the readers of this preface. The following is the beginning of a poem, tranſlated from the Norſe
   to the Gaëlic language ; and, from the latter, transferred into Engliſh. The verſe took little
   more time to the writer than the proſe; and even he himſelf is doubtful, (if he 
   <pb xml:id="P73100007" facs="../img/1773-032.pbm"/>
    has ſucceeded in either) which of them is the moſt literal verſion.</p>

   <p> The mountains of Sevo, </p></note> in ſnow ! The tempeſts roll dark on his ſides, but calm,
   above, his vaſt forehead appears, White-iſſuing from the ſkirt of his ſtorms, the troubled
   torrents pour down his ſides. Joining, as they roar along, they bear the Torno, in foam, to the
   main.</p>
   <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Grey</hi> on the bank and far from men, halfcovered by ancient pines, from the
   wind, a lonely pile exalts its head, long-ſhaken by the ſtorms of the north. To this fled Sigurd,
   fierce in fight, from Harold the leader of armies, when fate had brightened his ſpear,
   
   <pb xml:id="P73100008" facs="../img/1773-035.pbm"/>
    with renown: When he conquered in that rude field, where Lulan's warriors
   fell in blood, or roſe, in terror, on the waves of the main. Darkly ſat the grey-haired chief;
   yet ſorrow dwelt not in his ſoul. But when the warrior thought on the paſt, his proud heart
   heaved again his ſide: Forth-flew his ſword from its place, he wounded Harold in all the
   winds.</p>
   <p><hi rend="smallcaps">One</hi> daughter, and only one, but bright in form and mild of ſoul, the laſt
   beam of the ſetting line, remained to Sigurd of all his race. His ſon, in Lulan's battle ſlain,
   beheld not his father's flight from his foes. Nor finiſhed ſeemed the ancient line ! The ſplendid
   beauty of bright-eyed Fithon, covered ſtill the fallen king with renown. Her arm was white like
   Gormal's ſnow ; her boſom whiter than the foam of the main, when roll the waves beneath the wrath
   of the winds. Like two ſtars were her radiant eyes, like two ſtars that riſe on the deep, when
   dark tumult embroils the night. Pleaſant are their beams aloft, as ſtately they aſcend the
   ſkies.</p>
   
   <p><pb xml:id="P73100009" facs="../img/1773-038.pbm"/>
    <hi rend="smallcaps">Nor</hi> Odin forgot, in aught, the maid. Her form ſcarce
   equalled her lofty mind. Awe moved around her ſtately ſteps. Heroes loved—but ſhrunk away in
   their fears. Yet midſt the pride of all her charms, her heart was ſoft, and her ſoul was kind.
   She ſaw the mournful with tearful eyes. Tranſient darkneſs aroſe in her breaſt. Her joy was in
   the chace. Fach morning, when doubtful light wandered dimly on Lulan's waves, ſhe rouzed the
   reſounding woods, to Gormal's head of ſnow. Nor moved the maid alone, &amp;c. </p>

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">One</hi> of the chief improvements, on this edition, is the care taken, in
   arranging the poems in the order of time; ſo as to form a kind of regular hiſtory of the age to
   which they relate. The writer has now reſigned them for ever to their fate. That they have been
   well received by the public, appears from an extenſive ſale; that they ſhall continue to be well
   received, he may venture to prophecy without the gift of that inſpiration, to which poets lay
   claim. Through the medium of verſion upon verſion, they retain, in foreign languages, their
   native character of ſimplicity and energy. Genuine poetry, like gold, loſes little, when properly
   transfuſed ; but when a compoſition cannot bear the teſt of a literal verſion, it is a
   counterfeit which ought not to paſs current. The operation muſt, however, be performed with
   ſkilful hands. A tranſlator, who cannot equal his original, is incapable of expreſſing its
   beauties.</p>

     <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
     <p> <hi rend="smallcaps">Fingal</hi>, when very young, making a voyage to the Orkney Iſlands, was
      driven, by ſtreſs of weather, into a bay of Scandinavia, near the reſidence of Starno, king of
      Lochlins. Starno invites Fingal to a feaſt, Fingal, doubting the faith of the king, and
      mindful of a former breach of hoſpitality, refuſes to go.—Starno gathers together his tribes:
      Fingal reſolves to defend himſelf. — Night coming on, Duth-maruno propoſes to Fingal, to
      obſerve the motions of the enemy.— The king himſelf undertakes the watch. Advancing towards
      the enemy, he, accidentally, comes to the cave of Turthor, where Starno had confined
      Conban-carglas, the captive daughter of a neighbouring chief. — Her ſtory is imperfect, a part
      of the original being loſt.— Fingal comes to a place of worſhip, where Starno and his ſon,
      Swaran, conſulted the ſpirit of Loda, concerning the iſſue of the war.— The rencounter of
      Fingal and Swaran.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Duän</hi> firſt concludes with a deſcription of the airy
      hall of Cruth-loda ſuppoſed to be the Odin of Scandinavia. </p>

     <p>The bards diſtinguiſhed thoſe compoſitions, in which the narration is often interrupted, by
      epiſodes and apoſtrophes, by the name of <hi>Duän</hi>. Since the extinction of the order of
      the bards, it has been a general name for all ancient compoſitions in verſe. The abrupt manner
      in which the ſtory of this poem begins, may render it obſcure to ſome readers ; it may not
      therefore be improper, to give here the traditional preface, which is generally prefixed to
      it. Two years after he took to wife Ros-crana, the daughter of Cormac, king of Ireland, Fingal
      undertook an expedition into Orkney, to viſit his friend Cathulla, king of Iniſtore. After
      ſtaying a few days at Caric-thura, the reſidence of Cathulla, the king ſet ſail, to return to
      Scotland ; but, a violent ſtorm ariſing, his ſhips were driven into a bay of Scandinavia, near
      Gormal, the ſeat of Starno, king of Lochlin, his avowed enemy. Starno, upon the appearance of
      ſtrangers on his coaſt, ſummoned together the neighbouring tribes, and advanced, in a hoſtile
      manner, towards the bay of U-thorno, where Fingal had taken ſhelter. Upon diſcovering who the
      ſtrangers were, and fearing the valour of Fingal, which he had, more than once, experienced
      before, he reſolved to accompliſh by treachery what he was afraid he ſhould fail in by open
      force. He invited, therefore, Fingal to a feaſt, at which he intended to aſſaſſinate him, The
      king prudently declined to go, and Starno betook himſelf to arms. The ſequel of the ſtory may
      be learned from the poem itſelf. </p></note> FIRST.</head>

      but the poems, which contained the detail of them, are long ſince loſt. He lived, it is
      ſuppoſed, in that part of the north of Scotland, which is over againſt Orkney. Duth-maruno,
      Cromma-glas, Struthmor, and Cormar, are mentioned, as attending Comhal, in his laſt battle
      againſt the tribe of Morni, in a poem, which is ſtill preſerved. It is not the work of Oſſian
      ; the phraſeology betrays it to be a modern compoſition. It is ſomething like thoſe trivial
      compoſitions, which the Iriſh bards forged, under the name of Oſſian, in the fifteenth and
      ſixteenth centuries. Duth-maruno ſignifies, <hi>black and ſteady</hi>; Cromma-glas,
      <hi>bending and ſwarthy</hi>; Struthmor, <hi>roaring ſtream</hi> ; Cormar, <hi>expert at
      ſea</hi>. </p>

     Trenmor, the ruler of wars. “Come down, thus Trenmor ſaid, thou dweller between the harps. Thou

      famous, in the expeditions of Oſſian, after the death of Fingal. The traditional tales

      of boars)</hi> it would appear, that he applied himſelf to that kind of hunting, which his
      father, in this paragraph, is ſo anxious to recommend to him. As I have mentioned the
      traditional tales of the Highlands, it may not be improper here, to give ſome account of them.
      After the expulſion of the bards, from the houſes of the chiefs, they, being an indolent race
      of men, owed all their ſubſiſtence to the generoſity of the vulgar, whom they diverted with
      repeating the compoſitions of their predeceſſors, and running up the genealogies of their
      entertainers to the family of their chiefs. As this ſubject was, however, ſoon exhauſted, they
      were obliged to have recourſe to invention, and form ſtories having no foundation in fact
      which were ſwallowed, with great credulity, by an ignorant multitude. By frequent repeating,
      the fable grew upon their hands, and, as each threw in whatever circumſtance he thought
      conducive to raiſe the admiration of his hearers, the ſtory became, at laſt, ſo devoid of all
      probability, that even the vulgar themſelves did nor believe it. They, however, liked the
      tales ſo well, that the bards found their advantage in turning profeſſed tale makers. They
      then launched out into the wildeſt regions of fiction and romance. I firmly believe, there are
      more ſtories of giants, enchanted caſtles, dwarfs, and palfreys, in the Highlands, than in any
      country in Europe. Theſe tales, it is certain, like other romantic compoſitions, have many
      things in them unnatural, and, conſequently, diſguſtful to true taſte, but, I know not how it
      happens, they command attention more than any other fictions I ever met with. The extreme
      length of theſe pieces is very ſurpriſing, ſome of them requiring many days to repeat them,
      but ſuch hold they take of the memory, that few circumſtances are ever omitted by thoſe who
      have received them only from oral tradition : What is ſtill more amazing, the very language of
      the bards is ſtill preſerved. It is curious to ſee, that the deſcriptions of magnificence,
      introduced in theſe tales, is even ſuperior to all the pompous oriental fictions of the kind.

     <p>Torcul-torno, according to tradition, was king of Crathlun, a diſtrict in Sweden. The river
      Lulan ran near the reſidence of Torcul-torno. There is a river in Sweden, ſtill called Lula,
      which is probably the ſame with Lulan. The war between Starno and Torcul-torno, which
      terminated in the death of the latter, had its riſe at a hunting party. Starno being invited,
      in a friendly manner, by Torcul-rorno, both Kings, with their followers, went to the mountains
      of Stivamore, to hunt. A boar ruſhed from the wood before the kings, and Torcul-torno killed
      it. Starno thought this behaviour a breach upon the privilege of gueſts, who were always,
      <hi>honoured</hi>, as tradition expreſſes it, <hi>with the danger of the chace</hi>. A quarrel
      aroſe, the kings came to battle, with all their attendants, and the party of Torcul-torno were
      totally defeated, and he himſelf ſlain. Starno purſued his victory, laid waſte the diſtrict of
      Crathlun, and, coming to the reſidence of Torcul torno, carried off, by force, Conban-carglas,

     <note xmlns:t="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="bottom">
     <p> In this ſhort epiſode we have a very probable account given us, of the origin of monarchy
      in Caledonia. The <hi>Caël</hi> or Gauls, who poſeſſed the countries to the north of the Firth
      of Edinburgh, were, originally, a number of diſtinct tribes, or clans, each ſubject to its own
      chief, who was free and independent of any other power. When the Romans invaded them, the
      common danger might, perhaps, have induced thoſe <hi xml:lang="la">reguli</hi> to join
      together, but, as they were unwilling to yield to the command of one of their own number,
      their battles were ill-conducted, and, conſequently, unſucceſsful. Trenmor was the firſt who
      repreſented to the chiefs, the bad conſequences of carrying on their wars in this irregular
      manner, and adviſed, that they themſelves ſhould alternately lead in battle. They did ſo, but
      they were unſucceſsful. When it came to Trenmor's turn, he totally defeated the enemy, by his
      ſuperior valour and conduct, which gained him ſuch an intereſt among the tribes, that he, and
      his family after him, were regarded as kings; or to uſe the poet's expreſſion, <hi>the words
      of power ruſhed forth from Selma of kings</hi>. The regal authority, however, except in time
      of war, was but inconſiderable; for every chief, within his own diſtrict, was abſolute and
      independent. From the ſcene of the battle in this epiſode, (which was in the valley of Crona,
      a little to the north of Agricola's wall) I ſhould ſuppoſe, that the enemies of the
      Caledonians were the Romans, or provincial Britons. </p>
     </note> <hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> deeds of old, ſaid Duth-maruno, are like paths to our eyes, O
     Fingal. Broad-ſhielded Trenmor, is ſtill ſeen, amidſt his own dim years. Nor feeble was the
     ſoul of the king. There, no dark deed wandered in ſecret. From their hundred ſtreams came the
     tribes, to graſſy Colglancrona. Their chiefs were before them. Each ſtrove to lead the war.
     Their ſwords were often half-unſheathed. Red rolled their eyes of rage. 
     <pb xml:id="P73110019" facs="../img/1773-108.pbm"/>
      Separate they ſtood, and hummed their ſurly ſongs. “Why ſhould they
     yield to each other ? their fathers were equal in war.” Trenmor was there, with his people,
     ſtately in youthful locks. He ſaw the advancing foe. The grief of his ſoul aroſe. He bade the
     chiefs to lead, by turns : they led, but they were rolled away. From his own moſſy hill,
     blue-ſhielded Trenmor came down. He led wide-ſkirted battle, and the ſtrangers failed. Around
     him the dark-browed warriors came : they ſtruck the ſhield of joy. Like a pleaſant gale, the
     words of power ruſhed forth from Selma of kings. But the chiefs led, by turns, in war, till
     mighty danger roſe : then was the hour of the king to conquer in the field.</p>

     <p> In tradition, this Cromma glas makes a great figure in that battle which Comhal loſt,
      together with his life, to the tribe of Morni. I have juſt now, in my hands, an Iriſh
      compoſition, of a very modern date, as appears from the language, in which all the traditions,
      concerning that deciſive engagement, are jumbled together. In juſtice to the merit of the
      poem, I ſhould have here preſented to the reader a tranſlation of it, did not the bard mention
      ſome circumſtances very ridiculous, and others altogether indecent. Morna, the wife of Comhal,
      had a principal hand in all the tranſactions previous to the defeat and death of her huſband ;
      ſhe, to uſe the words of the bard, <hi>who was the guiding ſtar of the women of Erin</hi>. The
      bard, it is to be hoped, miſrepreſented the ladies of his country, for Morna's behaviour was,
      according to him, ſo void of all decency and virtue, that it cannot be ſuppoſed, they had
      choſen her for their <hi>guiding ſtar</hi>, The poem conſiſts of many ſtanzas. The language is
      figurative, and the numbers harmonious ; but the piece is ſo full of anachroniſms, and ſo
      unequal in its compoſition, that the author, moſt undoubtedly, was either mad, or drunk, when
      he wrote it. It is worthy of being remarked, that Comhal is, in this poem, very often called,
      <hi xml:lang="ga">Comhal na h'Albin</hi>, or <hi>Comhal of Albion</hi>, which ſufficiently

     <p> The bards, who were always ready to ſupply what they thought deficient in the poems of
      Oſſian, have inſerted a great many incidents between the ſecond and third <hi>duän</hi> of
      Cathloda. Their interpolations are ſo eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the genuine remains of Oſſian,
      that it took me very little time to mark them out, and totally to reject them. If the modern
      Scotch and Iriſh bards have ſhewn any judgment, it is in aſcribing their own compoſitions to
      names of antiquity, for, by that means, they themſelves have eſcaped that contempt, which the
      authors of ſuch futile performances muſt, neceſſarily, have met with, from people of true
      taſte. I was led into this obſervation, by an Iriſh poem, juſt now before me. It concerns a
      deſcent made by Swaran, king of Lochlin, on Ireland, and is the work, ſays the traditional
      preface prefixed to it, of <hi>Oſſian Mac-Fion</hi>. It however appears, from ſeveral pious
      ejaculations, that it was rather the compoſition of ſome good prieſt, in the fifteenth or
      ſixteenth century, for he ſpeaks; with great devotion, of pilgrimage, and more particularly,
      of the <hi>blue-eyed daughters of the convent</hi>. Religious, however, as this poet was, he
      was not altogether decent, in the ſcenes he introduces between Swaran and the wife of
      <hi>Congcullion</hi>, both of whom he repreſents as giants. It happening unfortunately, that
      <hi>Congcullion</hi> was only of a moderate ſtature, his wife without heſitation, preferred
      Swaran, as a more adequate match for her own gigantic ſize. From this fatal preference
      proceeded ſo much miſchief, that the good poet altogether loſt ſight of his principal action,
      and he ends the piece, with an advice to men, in the choice of their wives, which, however
      good it may be, I ſhall leave concealed in the obſcurity of the original. </p>

     <p> The ſurly attitude of Starno and Swaran is well adapted to their fierce and uncomplying

      we find that the poet has dexterouſly diſtinguiſhed between them. They were both dark,
      ſtubborn, haughty and reſerved ; but Starno was cunning, revengeful, and cruel, to the higheſt
      degree; the diſpoſition of Swaran, though ſavage, was leſs bloody, and ſomewhat tinctured with
      generoſity. It is doing injuſtice to Oſſian, to ſay, that he has not a great variety of

     death from his eyes, along the ſtriving fields. His joy was in the fall of men. Blood, to him,
     was a ſummer ſtream, that brings joy to withered vales, from its own moſſy rock. He came forth
     to the lake Luth-cormo, to meet the tall Colman-trunar, he from Urlor of ſtreams, dweller of

    <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> chief of Urlor had come to Gormal, with his dark-boſomed ſhips. He

   <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
   <p> This poem is valuable on account of the light it throws on the antiquity of Oſſian's
    compoſitions, The Caracul mentioned here is the ſame with Caracalla the ſon of Severus, who in
    the year 211 commanded an expedition againſt the Caledonians, The variety of the meaſure ſhews
    that the poem was originally ſet to muſic, and perhaps preſented before the chiefs upon ſolemn
    occaſions. Tradition has handed down the ſtory more complete than it is in the poem. “Comala,
    the daughter of Sarno king of Iniſtore or Orkney iſlands, fell in love with Fingal the ſon of
    Comhal at a feaſt, to which her father had invited him, [Fingal, B. III.] upon his return from
    Lochlin, after the death of Apandecca. Her paſſion was ſo violent, that ſhe followed him,
    diſguiſed like a youth, who wanted to be employed in his wars. She was ſoon diſcovered by
    Hidallan the ſon of Lamor, one of Fingal's heroes, whoſe love ſhe had ſlighted ſome time before.
    Her romantic paſſion and beauty recommended her ſo much to the king, that he had reſolved to
    make her his wife ; when news was brought him of Caracul's expedition. He marched to ſtop the
    progreſs of the enemy, and Comala attended him. He left her on a hill, within ſight of Caracul's
    army, when he himſelf went to battle, having previouſly promiſed, if he ſurvived, to return that
    night,” The ſequel of the ſtory may be gathered from the poem itſelf. </p>

   <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
   <p>Fingal, returning from an expedition which he had made into the Roman province, reſolved to
    viſit Cathulla king of Iniſtore, and brother to Comala, whoſe ſtory is related, at large, in the
    preceding dramatic poem. Upon his coming in ſight of Carric-thura, the palace of Cathulla, he
    obſerved a flame on its top, which, in thoſe days, was a ſignal of diſtreſs. The wind drove him
    into a bay, at ſome diſtance from Carric-thura, and he was obliged to paſs the night on the
    ſhore. Next day he attacked the army of Frothal king of Sora, who had beſieged Cathulla in his
    palace of Carric-thura, and took Frothal himſelf priſoner, after he had engaged him in a ſingle
    combat. The deliverance of Carric-thura is the ſubject of the poem, but ſeveral other epiſodes
    are interwoven with it. It appears from tradition, that this poem was addreſſed to a Culdee, or
    one of the firſt Chriſtian miſſionaries, and that the ſtory of the <hi>Spirit of Loda</hi>,
    ſuppoſed to be the ancient Odin of Scandinavia, was introduced by Oſſian in oppoſition to the
    Culdee's doctrine. Be this as it will, it lets us into Oſſian's notions of a ſuperior being; and
    ſhews that he was not addicted to the ſuperſtition which prevailed all the world over, before
    the introduction of Chriſtianity. </p>

   <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
   <p> This poem is compleat, and the ſubject of it, as of moſt of Oſſian's compoſitions, tragical.
    In the time of Comhal the ſon of Trathal, and father of the celebrated Fingal, Cleſsámmor the
    ſon of Thaddu and brother of Morna, Fingal's mother, was driven by a ſtorm into the river Clyde,
    on the banks of which ſtood Balclutha, a town belonging to the Britons between the walls. He was
    hoſpitably received by Reuthámir, the principal man in the place, who gave him Moina his only
    daughter in marriage. Reuda, the ſon of Cormo, a Briton who was in love with Moina, came to
    Reuthamir's houſe, and behaved haughtily towards Cleſsámmor. A quarrel inſued, in which Reada
    was killed ; the Britons, who attended him preſſed ſo hard on Cleſsámmor, that he was obliged to
    throw himſelf into the Clyde, and ſwim to his ſhip. He hoiſted ſail, and the wind being
    favourable, bore him out to ſea. He often endeavoured to return, and carry off his beloved Moina
    by night; but the wind continuing contrary, he was forced to deſiſt.</p>
   <p>Moina, who had been left with child by her huſband, brought forth a ſon, and died ſoon after.
    — Reuthámir named the child Carthon, <hi>i. e. the murmur of waves</hi>, from the ſtorm which
    carried off Cleſsámmor his father, who was ſuppoſed to have been caſt away. When Carthon was
    three years old, Comhal the father of Fingal, in one of his expeditions againſt the Britons,
    took and burnt Balclutha, Reuthámir was killed in the attack: and Carthon was carried ſafe away
    by his nurſe, who fled farther into the country of the Britons. Carthon, coming to man's eſtate
    was reſolved to revenge the fall of Balclutha on Comhal's poſterity. He ſet ſail, from the
    Clyde, and, falling on the coaſt of Morven, defeated two of Fingal's heroes, who came to oppoſe
    his progreſs. He was, at laſt, unwittingly killed by his father Cleſsámmor, in a ſingle combat.
    This ſtory is the foundation of the preſent poem, which opens on the night preceding the death
    of Carthon, ſo that what paſſed before is introduced by way of epiſode. The poem is addreſſed to
    Malvina the daughter of Toſcar. </p>

    the praiſe of unhappy Moina. Call her ghoſt, with your ſongs, to our hills;
   that ſhe may reſt with the fair of Morven, the ſun-beams of other days, the delight of heroes of
   old. I have ſeen the walls of Balclutha, but they were deſolate. The fire had reſounded in the
   halls: and the voice of the people is heard no more. The ſtream of Clutha was removed from its
   place, by the fall of the walls. The thiſtle ſhook, there, its lonely head: the moſs whiſtled to
   the wind. The fox looked out, from the windows, the rank graſs of the wall waved round its head.
   Deſolate is the dwelling of Moina, ſilence is in the houſe of her fathers. Raiſe the ſong of
   mourning, O bards, over the land of ſtrangers. They have but fallen before us: for, one day, we
   muſt fall. Why doſt thou build the hall, ſon of the winged days? Thou lookeſt from thy towers
   to-day ; yet a few years, and the blaſt of the deſart comes; it howls in thy empty court, and
   whiſtles round thy half-worn ſhield. And let the blaſt of the deſart come! we ſhall be renowned

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Such</hi> was the ſong of Fingal, in the day of his joy. His thouſand bards
   leaned forward from their ſeats, to hear the voice of the king. It was like the muſic of harps on
   the gale of the ſpring: Lovely were thy thoughts, O Fingal ! why had not Oſſian the ſtrength of
   thy ſoul ? But thou ſtandeſt alone, my father ! who can equal the king of Selma ?</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> night paſſed away in ſong; morning returned in joy. The mountains ſhewed
   their grey heads; the blue face of ocean ſmiled. The white wave is ſeen tumbling round the
   diſtant rock; a miſt roſe, ſlowly, from the lake. It came, in the figure of an aged man, along
   the ſilent plain. Its large limbs did not move in ſteps; for a ghoſt ſupported it in mid air. It
   came towards Selma's hall, and diſſolved in a ſhower of blood.</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> king alone beheld the ſight ; he foreſaw the death of the people. He
   came, in ſilence, to his hall; and took his father's ſpear. The mail rattled on his breaſt. The

    other, marking the eyes of Fingal. They ſaw battle in his face : the death
   of armies on his ſpear. A thouſand ſhields, at once, are placed on their arms; they drew a
   thouſand ſwords. The hall of Selma brightened around. The clang of arms aſcends. The grey dogs
   howl in their place. No word is among the mighty chiefs. Each marked the eyes of the king; and
   half aſſumed his ſpear.</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sons</hi> of Morven, begun the king, this is no time to fill the ſhell. The
   battle darkens near us; death hovers over the land. Some ghoſt, the friend of Fingal, has

   the water, came the ſign of Morven's gloomy danger. Let each aſſume his heavy ſpear, each gird on
   his father's ſword. Let the dark helmet riſe on every head; the mail pour its lightening from
   every ſide. The battle gathers like a ſtorm; ſoon ſhall ye hear the roar of death.</p>

    wave deceived them for diſtant ſails; the tear is on their cheek ! The

   <p> In the north of Scotland, till very lately, they burnt a large trunk of an oak at their

   Perhaps the huſband of Moina will mourn over his fallen Carthon.” His words reached the heart of
   Cleſsámmor : he fell, in ſilence, on his ſon. The hoſt ſtood darkened around: no voice is on the
   plain. Night came, the moon, from the eaſt, looked on the mournful field : but ſtill they ſtood,
   like a ſilent grove that lifts its head on Gormal, when the loud winds are laid, and dark autumn

   diſtant countries. The bare opinion of Tacitus, (which, by-the-bye, was only ſounded on a
   ſimilarity of the perſonal figure of the Caledonians to the Germans of his own time) tho' it has
   ſtaggered ſome learned men, is not ſufficient to make us believe, that the antient inhabitants of
   North-Britain were a German colony. A diſcuſſion of a point like this might be curious, but could
   never be ſatisfactory. Periods ſo diſtant are ſo involved in obſcurity, that nothing certain can
   be now advanced concerning them. The light which the Roman writers hold forth is too feeble to
   guide us to the truth, thro' the darkneſs which has ſurrounded it. </p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">From</hi> Col-amon came a bard, from Car-ul, the friend of ſtrangers, He bade us to the feaſt

   <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
   <p> Gaul, the ſon of Morni, attended Lathmon into his own country, after his being defeated in
    Morven, as related in the preceding poem. He was kindly entertained by Nuäth, the father of
    Lathmon, and fell in love with his daughter Oithona. The lady was no leſs enamoured of Gaul, and
    a day was fixed for their marriage. In the mean time Fingal, preparing for an expedition into
    the country of the Britons, ſent for Gaul. He obeyed, and went; but not without promiſing to
    Oithona to return, if he ſurvived the war, by a certain day. Lathmon too was obliged to attend
    his father Nuäth in his wars, and Oithona was left alone at Dunlathmon, the ſeat of the family.
    Dunrommath, lord of Uthal, ſuppoſed to be one of the Orkneys, taking advantage of the abſence of
    her friends, came and carried off, by force, Oithona, who had formerly rejected his love, into
    Tromithon, a deſart iſland, where he concealed her in a cave.</p>
   <p>Gaul returned on the day appointed; heard of the rape, and ſailed to Tromathon, to revenge
    himſelf on Dunrommath. When he landed, he found Oithona diſconſolate, and reſolved not to
    ſurvive the loſs of her honour. She told him the ſtory of her misfortunes, and ſhe ſcarce ended,
    when Dunrommath, with his followers, appeared at the further end of the iſland. Gaul prepared to
    attack him, recommending to Oithona to retire, till the battle was over. She ſeemingly obeyed ;
    but ſhe ſecretly armed herſelf, ruſhed into the thickeſt of the battle, and was mortally
    wounded. Gaul purſuing the flying enemy, found her juſt expiring on the field; he mourned over
    her, raiſed her tomb, and returned to Morven. Thus is the ſtory handed down by tradition ; nor
    is it given with any material difference in the Poem, which opens with Gaul's return to
    Dunlathmon, after the rape of Oithona. </p>

    when ſhe ſaw Gaul in his arms, ſhe ſtarted and turned her eyes away. Her lovely cheek is bent

    thrice her ſteps failed her as ſhe went !</p>
   <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Daughter</hi> of Nuäth,” ſaid the hero, “why doſt thou fly from Gaul. Do my

    Oſſian, to divert her grief, relates his own actions in an expedition which he undertook, at
    Fingal's command, to aid Crothar the petty king of Croma, a country in Ireland, againſt Rothmar
    who invaded his dominions. The ſtory is delivered down thus in tradition. Crothar king of Croma
    being blind with age, and his ſon too young for the field, Rothmar the chief of Tromlo reſolved
    to avail himſelf of the opportunity offered of annexing the dominions of Crothar to his own. He
    accordingly marched into the country ſubject to Crothar, but which he held of Arth or Artho, who

   ? let the aged feel thine arm !”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">I gave</hi> my arm to the king; he felt it with his aged hands. The ſigh roſe in

   Morven! But who is like the hero among the mighty in war! Let the feaſt of my hall be ſpread; and
   let my bards exalt the ſong. Great is he that is within my walls, ye ſons of ecchoing Croma !”
   The feaſt is ſpread. The harp is heard; and joy is in the hall. But it was joy covering a ſigh,
   that darkly dwelt in every breaſt. It was like the faint beam of the moon ſpread on a cloud in
   heaven. At length the muſic ceaſed, and the aged king of Croma ſpoke; he ſpoke without a tear,

  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Son</hi> of Fingal! behold'ſt thou not the darkneſs of Crothar's joy? My ſoul

   ſtreak of light behind. He is fallen, ſon of Fingal, in the wars of his father. Rothmar the chief
   of graſſy Tromlo heard that theſe eyes had failed; he heard that my arms were fixed in the hall,

   was great ; the fire of valour burnt in his eyes. He ſaw the diſordered ſteps of his father, and
   his ſigh aroſe. “King of Croma,” he ſaid, “is it becauſe thou haſt no ſon; is it for the weakneſs
   of Forar-gormo's arm that thy ſighs ariſe ? I begin, my father, to feel my ſtrength ; I have
   drawn the ſword of my youth; and I have bent the bow. Let me meet this Rothmar, with the ſons of
   Croma : let me meet him, O my father; I feel my burning ſoul!” And thou ſhalt meet him, I ſaid,
   ſon of the ſightleſs Crothar ! But let others advance before thee, that I may hear the tread of
   thy feet at thy return; for my eyes behold thee not, fair-haired Fovar-gormo ! He went, he met
   the foe; he fell. Rothmar advances to Croma. He who ſlew my ſon is near, with all his pointed

   <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
   <p>This piece, as many more of Oſſian's compoſitions, is addreſſed to one of the firſt Chriſtian
    miſſionaries. The ſtory of the poem is handed down, by tradition, thus. In the country of the
    Britons between the walls, two chiefs lived in the days of Fingal, Dunthalmo, lord of Teutha,
    ſuppoſed to be the Tweed ; and Rathmor, who dwelt at Clutha, well known to be the river Clyde.
    Rathmore was not more renowned for his generoſity and hoſpitality, than Dunthalmo was infamous
    for his cruelty and ambition. Dunthalmo, through envy, or on account of ſome private feuds,
    which ſubſiſted between the families, murdered Cathmore at a feaſt ; but being afterwards
    touched with remorſe, he educated the two ſons of Rathmore, Calthon and Colmar, in his own
    houſe. They growing up to man's eſtate, dropped ſome hints that they intended to revenge the
    death of their father, upon which Dunthilmo ſhut them up in two caves on the banks of Teutha,
    intending to take them off privately. Colmal, the daughter of Dunthalmo, who was ſecretly in
    love with Calthon, helped him to make his eſcape from priſon, and fled with him to Fingal,
    diſguiſed in the habit of a young warrior, and implored his aid againſt Dunthalmo. Fingal ſent
    Oſſian with three hundred men, to Colmar's relief. Dunthalmo having previouſly murdered Colmar,
    came to a battle with Oſſian; but he was killed by that hero, and his army totally defeated,</p>
   <p>Calthon married Colmal, his deliverer; and Oſſian returned to Morven. </p>

  <p> <hi rend="smallcaps">Pleasant</hi> is the voice of thy ſong, thou lonely dweller of the rock. It
   comes on the ſound of the ſtream, along the narrow vale. My ſoul awakes, O ſtranger! in the midſt
   of my hall. I ſtretch my hand to the ſpear, as in the days of other years. I ſtretch my hand, but
   it is feeble ; and the ſigh of my boſom grows. Wilt thou not liſten, ſon of the rock, to the ſong
   of Oſſian ? My ſoul is full of other times ; the joy of my youth returns. Thus the ſun appears in
   the weſt, after the ſteps of his brightneſs have moved behind a ſtorm ; the green hills lift
   their dewy heads. the blue ſtreams rejoice in the vale. The aged hero comes forth on his ſtaff;
   his grey hair glitters in the beam. Doſt thou not behold, ſon of the rock, a ſhield in Oſſian's
   hall ? It is marked with the ſtrokes of battle; and the brightneſs of its boſſes has failed,
   
   <pb xml:id="P73110142" facs="../img/1773-465.pbm"/>
    That ſhield the great Dunthalmo bore, the chief of ſtreamy
   Teutha. Dunthalmo bore it in battle, before he fell by Oſſian's ſpear. Liſten, ſon of the rock,
   to the tale of other years !</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rathmor</hi> was a Chief of Clutha. The feeble dwelt in his hall. The gates of
   Rathmor were never ſhut; his feaſt was always ſpread. The ſons of the ſtranger came. They bleſſed
   the generous chief of Clutha. Bards raiſed the ſong, and touched the harp: joy brightened on the
   face of the ſad ! Dunthalmo came, in his pride, and ruſhed into the combat of Rathmor. The chief
   of Clutha overcame : the rage of Dunthalmo roſe. He came, by night, with his warriors; the mighty
   Rathmor fell. He fell in his halls, where his feaſt was often ſpread for ſtrangers.</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Colmar</hi> and Calthon were young, the ſons of car-borne Rathmor. They came, in
   the joy of youth, into their father's hall. They behold him in his blood ; their burſting tears

   <p> Al-teutha, or rather Balteutha, <hi>the town of Tweed</hi>, the name of Dunthalmo's ſeat. It

   <pb xml:id="P73110143" facs="../img/1773-468.pbm"/>
    their foe. They bent the bow in his preſence ; and came forth to his
   wars. They ſaw the fallen walls of their fathers; they ſaw the green thorn in the hall. Their
   tears ruſhed forth in ſecret. At times, their faces were ſad. Dunthalmo beheld their grief: his
   darkening ſoul deſigned their death. He cloſed them in two caves, on the ecchoing banks of
   Teutha. The ſun did not come there with his beams ; nor the moon of heaven by night. The ſons of
   Rathmor remained in darkneſs, and foreſaw their death.</p>

   <p> That is, the hall where the arms taken from enemies were hung up as trophies. Oſſian is very
    careful to make his ſtories probable; for he makes Colmal put on the arms of a youth killed in

    carry the armour of a full-grown warrior. </p>

    followed our ſteps : the lovely ſtrangers were at my ſide. Dunthalmo
   heard the ſound of our approach. He gathered the ſtrength of Teutha. He ſtood on a hill with his
   hoſt. They were like rocks broken with thunder, when their bent trees are ſinged and bare, and
   the ſtreams of their chinks have failed. The ſtream of Teutha rolled, in its pride, before the
   gloomy foe. I ſent a bard to Dunthalmo, to offer the combat on the plain ; but he ſmiled in the
   darkneſs of his pride. His unſettled hoſt moved on the hill ; like the mountain-cloud, when the
   blaſt has entered its womb, and ſcatters the curling gloom on every ſide.</p>
  <p>They brought Colmar to Teutha's bank, bound with a thouſand thongs. The chief is ſad, but
   ſtately. His eye is on his friends ; for we ſtood, in our arms, whilſt Teutha's waters rolled
   between. Dunthalmo came with his ſpear, and pierced the hero's ſide : he rolled on the bank in
   his blood. We heard his broken ſighs. Calthon ruſhed into the ſtream : I bounded forward on my
   ſpear. Teutha's race fell before us. 
   <pb xml:id="P73110148" facs="../img/1773-483.pbm"/>
    Night came rolling down. Dunthalmo reſted on a rock, amidſt an
   aged wood. The rage of his boſom burned againſt the car-borne Calthon. But Calthon ſtood in his
   grief; he mourned the fallen Colmar ; Colmar ſlain in youth, before his fame aroſe!</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">I bade</hi> the ſong of woe to riſe, to ſooth the mournful chief; but he ſtood
   beneath a tree, and often threw his ſpear on earth. The humid eye of Colmal rolled near in a
   ſecret tear : ſhe foreſaw the fall of Dunthalmo, or of Clutha's warlike chief. Now half the night
   had paſſed away. Silence and darkneſs were on the field. Sleep reſted on the eyes of the heroes:
   Calthon's ſettling ſoul was ſtill. His eyes were half-cloſed ; but the murmur of Teutha had not
   yet failed in his ear. Pale, and ſhewing his wounds, the ghoſt of Colmar came: he bent his head
   over the hero, and raiſed his feeble voice !</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Sleeps</hi> the ſon of Rathmor in his night, and his brother low? Did we not
   riſe to the chace together? Purſued we not the dark-brown hinds ? Colmar was not forgot till he
   fell : till death had blaſted his youth. I lie pale beneath the rock of Lona. O let Calthon riſe!
   the morning comes with its beams; Durthalmo will diſhonour the fallen.” He paſſed away in his
   blaſt. The riſing Calthon ſaw the ſteps of his departure. 
   <pb xml:id="P73110149" facs="../img/1773-486.pbm"/>
    He ruſhed in the ſound of his ſteel. Unhappy Colmal roſe. She followed
   her hero through night, and dragged her ſpear behind. But when Calthon came to Lona's rock, he
   found his fallen brother. The rage of his boſom roſe; he ruſhed among the foe. The groans of
   death aſcend. They cloſe around the chief. He is bound in the midſt, and brought to gloomy
   Dunthalmo. The ſhout of joy aroſe ; and the hills of night replied.</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">I started</hi> at the ſound: and took my father's ſpear. Diaran roſe at my ſide;
   and the youthful ſtrength of Dargo. We miſſed the chief of Clutha, and our ſouls were ſad. I
   dreaded the departure of my fame. The pride of my valour roſe! “Sons of Morven,” I ſaid, “it is
   not thus our fathers fought. They reſted not on the field of ſtrangers, when the foe was not
   fallen before them. Their ſtrength was like the eagles of heaven; their renown is in the ſong.
   But our people fall by degrees. Our fame begins to depart. What ſhall the king of Morven ſay, if
   Oſſian conquers not at Teutha? Riſe in your ſteel, ye warriors; follow the ſound of Oſſian's
   courſe. He will not return, but renowned, to the ecchoing walls of Selma.”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Morning</hi> roſe on the blue waters of Teutha. Colmal ſtood before me in tears.
   She told of 
   <pb xml:id="P73110150" facs="../img/1773-489.pbm"/>
    the chief of Clutha : thrice the ſpear fell from her hand. My
   wrath turned againſt the ſtranger ; for my ſoul trembled for Calthon. “Son of the feeble hand,” I
   ſaid, “do Teutha's warriors fight with tears? The battle is not won with grief; nor dwells the
   ſigh in the ſoul of war. Go to the deer of Carmun, to the lowing herds of Teutha. But leave theſe
   arms, thou ſon of fear. A warrior may lift them in fight.”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">I tore</hi> the mail from her ſhoulders. Her ſnowy breaſt appeared. She bent her
   bluſhing face to the ground. I looked in ſilence to the chiefs. The ſpear fell from my hand ; the
   ſigh of my boſom roſe ! But when I heard the name of the maid, my crowding tears ruſhed down. I
   bleſſed the lovely beam of youth, and bade the battle move ! </p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Why</hi>, ſon of the rock, ſhould Oſſian tell how Teutha's warriors died ? They
   are now forgot in their land ; their tombs are not ſound on the heath. Years came on with their
   ſtorms. The green mounds are mouldered away. Scarce is the grave of Dunthalmo ſeen, or the place
   where he fell by the ſpear of Oſſian. Some grey warrior, half blind with age, ſitting by night at
   the flaming oak of the hall, tells now my deeds to his ſons, and the fall of the dark Dunthalmo,
   The faces of youth bend ſidelong 
   <pb xml:id="P73110151" facs="../img/1773-492.pbm"/>
    towards his voice. Surprize and joy burn in their eyes! I found Calthon
   bound to an oak ; my ſword cut the thongs from his hands. I gave him the white-boſomed Colmal.
   They dwelt in the halls of Teutha. </p>

   <p> Caros is probably the noted uſurper Carauſius, by birth a Menapian, who aſſumed the purple in
    the year 284: and, ſeizing on Britain, defeated the Emperor Maximian Herculius in ſeveral naval
    engagements, which gives propriety to his being called in this poem <hi>the king of ſhips</hi>.
    He repaired Agricola's wall, in order to obſtruct the incurſions of the Caledonians; and when he
    was employed in that work, it appears he was attacked by a party under the command of Oſcar the
    ſon of Oſſian. This battle is the foundation of the preſent poem, which is addreſſed to Malvina
    the daughter of Toſcar. </p>

  <head>THE WAR of CAROS: A POEM.</head>
  <p> <hi rend="smallcaps">Bring</hi>, daughter of Toſcar, bring the harp ! the light of the ſong riſes in
   Oſſian's ſoul ! It is like the field, when darkneſs covers the hills around, and the ſhadow grows
   ſlowly on the plain of the ſun. I behold my ſon, O Malvina, near the moſſy rock of Crona<note xmlns:t="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="bottom">
   <p> Crona is the name of a ſmall ſtream which runs into the Carron. </p>
   </note>. But it is the miſt of the deſart, tinged with the beam of the weſt ! Lovely is the miſt,

    lightens his face. He often looks back to Caros. It is Ryno<note xmlns:t="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="bottom">
   <p> Ryno is often mentioned in the ancient poetry, He ſeems to have been a Bard, of the firſt

   </note> of ſongs, he that went to view the foe. “What does Caros king of ſhips?” ſaid the ſon of
   the now mournful Oſſian, “ſpreads he the wings<note xmlns:t="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="bottom">
   <p> The Roman eagle. </p>
   </note> of his pride, bard of the times of old?” “He ſpreads them, Oſcar,” replied the bard, “but
   it is behind his gathered heap<note xmlns:t="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="bottom">
   <p> Agricola's wall which Carauſius repaired. </p>
   </note>. He looks over his ſtones with fear. He beholds thee terrible, as the ghoſt of night,

  <p>“Go, thou firſt of my bards,” ſays Oſcar, “take the ſpear of Fingal. Fix a flame on its point.
   Shake it to the winds of heaven. Bid him, in ſongs, to advance, and leave the rolling of his
   wave. Tell to Caros that I long for battle; that my bow is weary of the chace of Cona. Tell him
   the mighty are not here; and that my arm is young.”</p>
  <p>He went with the murmur of ſongs. Oſcar reared his voice on high. It reached his heroes on
   Ardven, like the noiſe of a cave; when the ſea of Togorma rolls before it; and its trees meet the
   roaring winds. They gather round 
   <pb xml:id="P73110157" facs="../img/1773-508.pbm"/>
    my ſon like the ſtreams of the hill ; when, after rain, they roll in the
   pride of their courſe. Ryno came to the mighty Caros. He ſtruck his flaming ſpear. Come to the
   battle of Oſcar, O thou that ſitteſt on the rolling of waves. Fingal is diſtant far; he hears the
   ſongs of bards in Morven : the wind of his hall is in his hair. His terrible ſpear is at his
   ſide; his ſhield that is like the darkened moon ! Come to the battle of Oſcar ; the hero is alone
   !</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi> came not over the ſtreamy Carun<note xmlns:t="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="bottom">

   <p>This is the ſcene of Comala's death, which is the ſubject of the dramatic poem. The poet

   the miſt of night.</p>
  <p>“Why art thou ſad ?” ſaid Ryno; for he alone beheld the chief. “Why art thou ſad, Hidallan?
   haſt thou not received thy fame ?

    The ſongs of Oſſian have been heard ; thy ghoſt has brightened in
   wind, when thou didſt bend from thy cloud, to hear the ſong of Morven's bard! “And do thine
   eyes,” ſaid Oſcar, “behold the chief, like the dim meteor of night ? Say, Ryno, ſay, how fell
   Hidallan, the renowned in the days of my fathers? His name remains on the rocks of Cona. I have
   often ſeen the ſtreams of his hills !”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fingal</hi>, replied the bard, drove Hidallan from his wars. The king's ſoul was
   ſad for Comala, and his eyes could not behold the chief. Lonely, ſad along the heath he, ſlowly,
   moved, with ſilent ſteps. His arms hang diſordered on his ſide. His hair flies looſe from his
   brow. The tear is in his down-caſt eyes; a ſigh half-ſilent in his breaſt! Three days he ſtrayed
   unſeen, alone, before he came to Lamor's halls : the moſſy halls of his fathers, at the ſtream of Balva<note xmlns:t="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="bottom">
   <p> This is perhaps that ſmall ſtream, ſtill retaining the name of Balva, which runs through the
    romantic valley of Glentivar in Stirlingſhire. Balva ſignifies <hi>a ſilent ſtream</hi>; and
    Glentivar, <hi>the ſequeſtered vale</hi>. </p>
   </note>. There Lamor ſat alone beneath a tree; for he had ſent his people with Hidallan to war.
   The ſtream ran at his feet, his grey head reſted on his ſtaff. Sightleſs are his aged eyes. He
   hums the ſong of other times. 
   <pb xml:id="P73110159" facs="../img/1773-514.pbm"/>
    The noiſe of Hidallan's feet came to his ear : he knew the tread of his
   ſon.</p>
  <p>“Is the ſon of Lamor returned; or is it the ſound of his ghoſt? Haſt thou fallen on the banks
   of Carun, ſon of the aged Lamor ? Or, if I hear the ſound of Hidallan's feet; where are the
   mighty in the war? where are my people, Hidallan, that were wont to return with their echoing
   ſhields? Have they fallen on the banks of Carun ?”</p>
  <p>“No: replied the ſighing youth, the people of Lamor live. They are renowned in war, my father;
   but Hidallan is renowned no more. I muſt ſit alone on the banks of Balva, when the roar of the
   battle grows.”</p>
  <p>“But thy fathers never ſat alone,” replied the riſing pride of Lamor. “They never ſat alone on
   the banks of Balva, when the roar of battle roſe. Doſt thou not behold that tomb ? My eyes
   diſcern it not; there reſts the noble Garmállon, who never fled from war! Come, thou renowned in
   battle, he ſays, come to thy father's tomb. How am I renowned, Garmállon? my ſon has fled from
   war!”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">King</hi> of the ſtreamy Balva !” ſaid Hidallan with a ſigh, “why doſt thou
   torment my ſoul? Lamor, I never fled. Fingal was ſad for 
   <pb xml:id="P73110160" facs="../img/1773-517.pbm"/>
    Comala ; he denied his wars to Hidallan. Go to the grey ſtreams of
   thy land, he ſaid ; moulder like a leafleſs oak, which the winds have bent over Balva, never more
   to grow!”</p>
  <p> “<hi rend="smallcaps">And</hi> muſt I hear,” Lamor replied, “the lonely tread of Hidallan's feet?
   When thouſands are renowned in battle, ſhall he bend over my grey ſtreams? Spirit of the noble
   Garmállon ! carry Lamor to his place; his eyes are dark; his ſoul is ſad ; his ſon has loft his
   fame !”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Where</hi>,” ſaid the youth, “ſhall I ſearch for fame to gladden the ſoul of
   Lamor? From whence ſhall I return with renown, that the ſound of my arms may be pleaſant in his
   ear ? If I go to the chace of hinds, my name will not be heard. Lamor will not feel my dogs, with
   his hands, glad at my arrival from the hill. He will not enquire of his mountains, or of the
   dark-brown deer of his deſarts !”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">I must</hi> fall,” ſaid Lamor, “like a leafleſs oak: it grew on a rock! it was
   overturned by the winds! My ghoſt will be ſeen on my hills, mournful for my young Hidallan. Will
   not ye, ye miſts, as ye riſe, hide him from my ſight? My ſon! go to Lamor's hall : there the arms
   of our fathers hang. Bring the ſword of Garmallon ; he took it from a foe!”</p>
  <p>
   
   
   <pb xml:id="P73110161" facs="../img/1773-520.pbm"/>
    He went and brought the ſword with all its ſtudded thongs. He gave it to
   his father. The grey-haired hero felt the point with his hand.</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">My</hi> ſon! lead me to Garmállon's tomb : it riſes beſide that ruſtling tree.
   The long graſs is withered; I hear the breezes whiſtling there. A little fountain murmurs near,
   and ſends its water to Balva. There let me reſt; it is noon ; the ſun is on our fields !”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi> led him to Garmállon's tomb. Lamor pierced the ſide of his ſon. They
   ſleep together : their ancient halls moulder away. Ghoſts are ſeen there at noon : the valley is
   ſilent, and the people ſhun the place of Lamor.</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Mournful</hi> is thy tale,” ſaid Oſcar, “ſon of the times of old ! My ſoul ſighs

   Send the night away in ſongs; watch the ſtrength of Caros. Oſcar goes to the people of other

   behind her hill. Feeble voices are heard on the heath. Oſcar drew his ſword !</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Come</hi>,” ſaid the hero, “O ye ghoſts of my fathers! ye that fought againſt

   you talk together and behold your ſons in the fields of the brave.”</p>
  <p> <hi rend="smallcaps">Trenmor</hi> came, from his hill, at the voice of his mighty ſon. A cloud, like
   the ſteed of the ſtranger, ſupported his airy limbs. His robe is of the miſt of Lano, that brings
   death to the people. His ſword is a green meteor half-extinguiſhed. His face is without form, and
   dark. He ſighed thrice over the hero : thrice the winds of night roared around ! Many were his
   words to Oſcar ; but they only came by halves to our ears: they were dark as the tales of other
   times, before the light of the ſong aroſe. He ſlowly vaniſhed, like a miſt that melts on the

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Oscar</hi> paſſed the night among his fathers, grey morning met him on Carun's

   they had paſſed the ſtream by night. They appeared, like the trunks of aged pines, to the pale
   light of the morning. Oſcar ſtood at the tomb, and raiſed thrice his terrible voice. The rocking
   hills ecchoed around ; the ſtarting roes bounded away: And the trembling ghoſts of the dead fled,
   ſhrieking on their clouds. So terrible was the voice of my ſon, when he called his friends!</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">A thousand</hi> ſpears aroſe around ; the people of Caros roſe. Why, daughter of

   the reſt of his thin form is unſeen; but the people die in the vale! My ſon beheld the approach
   of the foe; he ſtood in the ſilent darkneſs of his ſtrength. “Am I alone, ſaid Oſcar, in the

   behold my deeds in war! I may fall; but I will be renowned like the race of the ecchoing Morven.”
   He ſtood, growing in his place, like a flood in a narrow vale ! The battle came, but they fell :

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> noiſe reached his people at Crona ; they came like a hundred ſtreams.

   courſe; the earth is rocking round. Battle ſpreads from wing to wing : ten thouſand ſwords gleam
   at once in the ſky. But why ſhould Oſſian ſing of battles? For never more ſhall my ſteel ſhine in
   war. I remember the days of my youth with grief; when I feel the weakneſs of my arm. Happy are

    by dreams. The ſpirit of Trenmor appears to Oſſian and Oſcar : they ſail, from the bay of
    Carmona, and, on the fourth day, appear off the valley of Rath-col, in Inis-huna, where
    Duth-carmor had fixed his reſidence. Oſſian diſpatches a bard to Duth-carmor to demand battle.
    Night comes on. The diſtreſs of Cathlin of Clutha. Oſſian devolves the command on Oſcar, who,
    according to the cuſtom of the kings of Morven, before battle, retired to a neighbouring hill.
    Upon the coming on of day, the battle joins. Oſcar and Duth-carmor meet. The latter falls. Oſcar
    carries the mail and helmet of Duth-carmor to Cathlin, who had retired from the field. Cathlin
    is diſcovered to be the daughter of Cathmol, in diſguiſe, who had been carried off, by force,
    by, and had made her eſcape from, Duth-carmor. </p>

   <head>CATHLIN of CLUTHA: A POEM.</head>
   <p><note xmlns:t="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="bottom">
    <p> The traditions, which accompany this poem, inform us, that it went, of old, under the name
     of <hi>Laoi-Oi-lutha</hi>; i. e, the <hi>hymn of the maid of Lutha</hi>. They pretend alſo to
     fix the time of its compoſition, to the third year after the death of Fingal ; that is, during
     the expedition of Fergus the ſon of Fingal, to the banks of <hi>Uiſca-duthon</hi>. In ſupport
     of this opinion, the Highland ſenachies have prefixed to his poem, an addreſs of Oſſian, to
     Congal the young ſon of Fergus, which I have rejected, as having no manner of connection with
     the reſt of the piece. It has poetical merit ; and, probably, it was the opening of one of
     Oſſian's other poems, tho' the bards injudiciouſly transferred it to the piece now before
     us.</p>
    <p>
     <quote>“Congal, ſon of Fergus of Durath, thou light between thy locks, aſcend to the rock of
      Selma, to the oak of the breaker of ſhields. Look over the boſom of night, it is ſtreaked with
      the red paths of the dead: look on the night of ghoſts, and kindle, O Congal, thy ſoul. Be
      not, like the moon on a ſtream, lonely in the midſt of clouds : darkneſs cloſes around it ;
      and the beam departs, Depart not, ſon of Fergus, ere thou markeſt the field with thy ſword.
      Aſcend to the rock of Selma ; to the oak of the breaker of ſhields.” </quote>

     Selma. In this paragraph are mentioned the ſignals preſented to Fingal, by thoſe who came to
     demand his aid. The ſuppliants held, in one hand, a ſhield covered with blood, and, in the
     other, a broken ſpear ; the firſt a ſymbol of the death of their friends, the laſt an emblem of
     their own helpleſs ſituation, If the king choſe to grant ſuccours, which generally was the

    <p>It may not be diſagreeable to the reader to lay here before him the ceremony of the
     Cran-tara, which was of a ſimilar nature, and, till very lately, uſed in the Highlands. When
     the news of an enemy came to the reſidence of the chief, he immediately killed a goat with his
     own ſword, dipped the end of an half-burnt piece of wood in the blood, and gave it to one of
     his ſervants, to be carried to the next hamlet. From hamlet to hamlet this <hi>teſſera</hi> was
     carried with the utmoſt expedition, and, in the ſpace of a few hours, the whole clan were in
     arms, and convened in an appointed place; the name of which was the only word that accompanied
     the delivery of the <hi>Cran tara</hi>. This ſymbol was the manifeſto of the chief, by which he
     threatened fire and ſword to thoſe of his clan, that did not immediately appear at his

    youth, in arms, and ſtretched his pointleſs ſpear. Long, over his tearful eyes, hung looſe his
    diſordered locks. Fingal gave the ſhell of kings. The words of the ſtranger aroſe. “In his hall

    ſhould lift the ſhield ? for all had claimed the war. The night came down; we ſtrode, in

    the field. We ſtruck the ſhield of the dead : we raiſed the hum of ſongs. We thrice called the
    ghoſts of our fathers. We laid us down in dreams. Trenmor came, before mine eyes, the tall form
    of other years ! His blue hoſts were behind him in half-diſtinguiſhed rows. Scarce ſeen is their

  <head>SUL-MALLA OF LUMON: A POEM.</head>
  <p><note xmlns:t="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="bottom">
   <p>The expedition of Oſſian to Inis-huna happened a ſhort time before Fingal paſſed over into
    Ireland, to dethrone Cairbar the ſon of Borbar-duthul. Cathmor, the brother of Cairbar, was
    aiding Conmor, king of Inis-huna, in his wars, at the time that Oſſian defeated Duth-carmor, in
    the valley of Rath-col, The poem is more intereſting, that it contains ſo many particulars
    concerning thoſe perſonages, who make ſo great a figure in Temora.</p>
   <p>The exact correſpondence in the manners and cuſtoms of Inis-huna, as here deſcribed, to thoſe
    of Caledonia, leaves no room to doubt, that the inhabitants of both were originally the ſame
    people. Some may allege, that Oſſian might transfer, in his poetical deſcriptions, the manners
    of his own nation to foreigners. This objection is eaſily anſwered. Why has he not done this
    with regard to the inhabitants of Scandinavia? We find the latter very different in their
    cuſtoms and ſuperſtitions from the nations of Britain and Ireland. The Scandinavian manners are
    remarkably barbarous and fierce, and ſeem to mark out a nation much leſs advanced in a ſtate of
    civilization, than the inhabitants of Britain were in the times of Oſſian. </p>

   bard from her rock, to bid us to her feaſt. Amidſt the ſong we ſat down, in Cluba's ecchoing
   hall. White moved the hands of Sul-malla, on the trembling ſtrings. Half-heard amidſt the ſound,
   was the name of Atha's king : he that was abſent in battle for her own green land. Nor abſent
   from her ſoul was he; he came midſt her thoughts by night. Ton-thena looked in, from the ſky, and

   <p> Sul-malla here diſcovers the quality of Oſſian and Oſcar, from their ſtature and ſtately
    gait. Among nations, not far advanced in civilization, a ſuperior beauty and ſtatelineſs of
    perſon were inſeparable from nobility of blood. It was from theſe qualities, that thoſe of
    family were known by ſtrangers, not from tawdry trappings of ſtate injudiciouſly thrown round
    them. The cauſe of this diſtinguiſhing property, muſt, in ſome meaſure, be aſcribed to their
    unmixed blood. They had no inducement to intermarry with the vulgar: and no low notions of
    intereſt made them deviate from their choice, in their own ſphere. In ſtates, where luxury has
    been long eſtabliſhed, beauty of perſon is, by no means, the characteriſtic of antiquity of
    family. This muſt be attributed to thoſe enervating vices, which are inſeparable from luxury and
    wealth. A great family, (to alter a little the words of the hiſtorian) it is true, like a river,
    becomes conſiderable from the length of its courſe, but, as it rolls on, hereditary diſtempers,
    as well as property, flow ſucceſively into it. </p>

   <p> Too partial to our own times, we are ready to mark out remote antiquity, as the region of
    ignorance and barbariſm. This, perhaps, is extending our prejudices too far, It has been long
    remarked, that knowlege, in a great meaſure, is founded on a free intercourſe between mankind ;
    and that the mind is enlarged in proportion to the obſervations it has made upon the manners of
    different men and nations. If we look, with attention, into the hiſtory of Fingal, as delivered
    by Oſſian, we ſhall find that he was not altogether a poor ignorant hunter, confined to the
    narrow corner of an iſland. His expeditions to all parts of Scandinavia, to the north of
    Germany, and the different ſtates of Great Britain and Ireland, were very numerous, and
    performed under ſuch a character, and at ſuch times, as gave him an opportunity to mark the
    undiſguiſed manners of mankind. War and an active life, as they call forth, by turns, all the
    powers of the ſoul, preſent to us the different characters of men: in times of peace and quiet,
    for want of objects to exert them, the powers of the mind lie concealed, in a great meaſure, and
    we ſee only artificial paſſions and manners. It is from this conſideration I conclude, that a
    traveller of penetration could gather more genuine knowlege from a tour of ancient Gaul, than
    from the minuteſt obſervation of all the artificial manners, and elegant refinements of modern
    France. </p>

    highland ſenachies, who very often endeavoured to ſupply the deficiency, they thought they found
    in the tales of Oſſian, have given us the continuation of the ſtory of the daughter of
    Suran-dronlo. The cataſtrophe is ſo unnatural, and the circumſtances of it ſo ridiculouſly

   <p>The wildly beautiful appearance of Runo-forlo, made a deep impreſſion on a chief, ſome ages
    ago, who was himſelf no contemptible poet. The ſtory is romantic, but not incredible, if we make
    allowances for the lively imagination of a man of genius. Our chief ſailing, in a ſtorm, along
    one of the iſlands of Orkney, ſaw a woman, in a boat, near the ſhore, whom he thought, as he
    expreſſes it himſelf, <hi>as beautiful as a ſudden ray of the ſun, on the dark-heaving
    deep</hi>. The verſes of Oſſian, on the attitude of Runo-forlo, which was ſo ſimilar to that of
    the woman in the boat, wrought ſo much on his fancy, that he fell deſperately in love. The
    winds, however, drove him from the coaſt, and, after a few days, he arrived at his reſidence in
    Scotland. There his paſſion increaſed to ſuch a degree, that two of his friends, fearing the
    conſequence, ſailed to the Orkneys, to carry to him the object of his deſire. Upon enquiry they
    ſoon found the nymph, and carried her to the enamoured chief; but mark his ſurprize, when,
    inſtead <hi>of a ray of the fun</hi>, he ſaw a ſkinny fiſherwoman, more than middle aged,

   ! I ſee the heroes of Morven ; I hear the ſong of bards ! Oſcar lifts the ſword of Cormalo; a
   thouſand youths admire its ſtudded thongs. They look with wonder on my ſon: They admire the
   ſtrength of his arm. They mark the joy of his father's eyes; they long for an equal fame. And ye
   ſhall have your fame, O ſons of ſtreamy Morven! My ſoul is often brightened with ſong; I remember
   the friends of my youth. But ſleep deſcends, in the ſound of the harp! pleaſant dreams begin to
   riſe! Ye ſons of the chace ſtand far diſtant, nor diſturb my reſt. The bard of other times holds
   diſcourſe with his fathers, the chief of the days of old ! Sons of the chace, ſtand far diſtant !
   diſturb not the dreams of Oſſian !  </p>

  <p> Cuthullin, (general of the Iriſh tribes, in the minority of Cormac, king of Ireland) ſitting
   alone beneath a tree, at the gate of Tura, a caſtle of Ulſter, (the other chiefs having gone on a
   hunting party to Cromla, a neighbouring hill) is informed of the landing of Swaran, king of
   Lochlin, by Moran, the ſon of Fithil, one of his ſcouts. He convenes the chiefs ; a council is
   held, and diſputes run high about giving battle to the enemy. Connal, the petty king of Togorma,
   and an intimate friend of Cuthullin, was for retreating till Fingal, king of thoſe Caledonians
   who inhabited the north-weſt coaſt of Scotland, whoſe aid had been previouſly ſollicited, ſhould
   arrive ; but Calmar, the ſon of Matha, lord of Lara, a country in Connaught, was for engaging the
   enemy immediately. Cuthullin, of himſelf willing to fight, went into the opinion of Calmar.
   Marching towards the enemy, he miſſed three of his braveſt heroes, Fergus, Duchomar, and Cathba.
   Fergus arriving, tells Cuthullin of the death of the two other chiefs ; which introduces the
   affecting epiſode of Morna, the daughter of Cormac. The army of Cuthullin is deſcried at a
   diſtance by Swaran, who ſent the ſon of Arno to obſerve the motions of the enemy, while he
   himſelf ranged his forces in order of battle. The ſon of Arno returning to Swaran, deſcribes to
   him Cuthullin's chariot, and the terrible appearance of that hero. The armies engage, but night
   coming on, leaves the victory undecided. Cuthullin, according to the hoſpitality of the times,
   ſends to Swaran a formal invitation to a feaſt, by his bard Carril, the ſon of Kinfena. Swaran
   refuſes to come. Carril relates to Cuthullin the ſtory of Grudar and Braſſolis. A party, by
   Connal's advice, is ſent to obſerve the enemy ; which cloſes the action of the firſt day. </p>

   <p> Cuthullin having previous intelligence of the invaſion intended by Swaran, ſent ſcouts a!l
    over the coaſt of Ullin or Ulſter, to give early notice of the firſt appearance of the enemy, at
    the ſame time that he ſent Munan the ſon of Stirmal to implore the aſſiſtance of Fingal. He
    himſelf collected the flower of the Iriſh youth to Tura, a caſtle on the coaſt, to ſtop the
    progreſs of the enemy till Fingal ſhould arrive from Scotland. We may conclude from Cuthullin's
    applying ſo early for foreign aid, that the Iriſh were not then ſo numerous as they have ſince

  <p> The ghoſt of Crugal, one of the Iriſh heroes who was killed in battle, appearing to Connal,
   foretels the defeat of Cuthullin in the next battle; and earneſtly adviſes him to make peace with
   Swaran. Connal communicates the viſion; but Cuthullin is inflexible; from a principle of honour
   he would not be the firſt to ſue for peace, and he reſolved to continue the war. Morning comes;
   Swaran propoſes diſhonourable terms to Cuthullin, which are rejected. The battle begins, and is
   obſtinately fought for ſome time, until, upon the flight of Grumal, the whole Iriſh army gave
   way. Cuthullin and Connal cover their retreat: Carril leads them to a neighbouring hill, whither
   they are ſoon followed by Cuthullin himſelf, who deſcries the fleet of Fingal making towards the
   coaſt; but, night coming on, he loſt ſight of it again. Cuthullin, dejected after his defeat,
   attributes his ill ſucceſs to the death of Ferda his friend, whom he had killed ſome time before.
   Carril, to ſhew that ill ſucceſs did not always attend thoſe who innocently killed their friends,
   introduces the epiſode of Comal and Galvina. </p>

   ſupported his head. Shrill thro' the heath of Lena, he heard the voice of night. At diſtance from
   the heroes he lay ; the ſon of the ſword feared no foe! The hero beheld, in his reſt, a dark-red
   ſtream of fire ruſhing down from the hill. Crugal ſat upon the beam, a chief who fell in fight.
   He fell by the hand of Swaran, ſtriving in the battle of heroes. His face is like the beam of the

   <pb xml:id="P73110246" facs="../img/1773-769.pbm"/>
    moon. His robes are of the clouds of the hill. His eyes are
   two decaying flames ! Dark is the wound of his breaſt! “Crugal,” ſaid the mighty Connal, ſon of
   Dedgal famed on the hill of hinds ! “Why ſo pale and ſad, thou breaker of the ſhields? Thou haſt
   never been pale for fear! What diſturbs the departed Crugal?” Dim, and in tears, he ſtood and
   ſtretched his pale hand over the hero. Faintly he raiſed his feeble voice, like the gale of the
   reedy Lego !</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">My</hi> ſpirit, Connal, is on my hills: my corſe on the ſands of Erin. Thou
   ſhalt never talk with Crugal, nor find his lone ſteps in the heath. I am light as the blaſt of
   Cromla. I move like the ſhadow of miſt ! Connal, ſon of Colgar, I ſee a cloud of death: it hovers
   dark over the plains of Lena. The ſons of green Erin muſt fall. Remove from the field of ghoſts.”
   Like the darkened moon he retired, in the midſt of the whiſtling blaſt. “Stay,” ſaid the mighty
   Connal, “ſtay my dark-red friend. Lay by that beam of heaven, ſon of the windy Cromla! What cave
   is thy lonely houſe ? What green-headed hill the place of thy repoſe ? Shall we not hear thee in
   the ſtorm ? In the noiſe of the mountain-ſtream? When the feeble ſons of the wind come forth, and

   the ruler of the car, “comes Connal through my night? My ſpear might turn againſt the ſound; and
   Cuthullin mourn the death of his friend. Speak, Connal; ſon of Colgar, ſpeak, thy counſel is the
   ſun of heaven!” “Son of Semo!” replied the chief, “the ghoſt of Crugal came from his cave. The
   ſtars dim-twinkled through his form. His voice was like the ſound of a diſtant ſtream. He is a

   <p> The poet teaches us the opinions that prevailed in his time concerning the fate of ſeparate
    ſouls. From Connal's expreſſion, “That the ſtars dim-twinkled through the form of Crugal,” and
    Cuthullin's reply, we may gather that they both thought the ſoul was material, ſomething like
    the <hi>εἰδωλον</hi> of the ancient Greeks. </p>
   </note> of Crugal, why didſt thou not force him to my ſight ? Haſt thou enquired where is his

    But ſmall is his knowlege, Connal; he was here to-day. He could not
   have gone beyond our hills! who could tell him there of our fall?” “Ghoſts fly on clouds and ride
   on winds,” ſaid Connal's voice of wiſdom. “They reſt together in their caves, and talk of mortal
   men.”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Then</hi> let them talk of mortal men; of every man but Erin's chief. Let me be

   high-boſomed Bragéla. I fear not death, to fly I fear ! Fingal has ſeen me victorious ! Thou dim
   phantom of the hill, ſhew thyſelf to me ! come on thy beam of heaven, ſhew me my death in thine
   hand; yet I will not fly, thou feeble ſon of the wind! Go, ſon of Colgar, ſtrike the ſhield. It
   hangs between the ſpears. Let my warriors riſe to the ſound, in the midſt of the battles of Erin.
   Though Fingal delays his coming with the race of his ſtormy iſles; we ſhall fight, O Colgar's
   ſon, and die in the battle of heroes !”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> ſound ſpreads wide. The heroes riſe, like the breaking of a blue-rolling

   ſilence ſpread over his iſle.” They roſe ruſtling like a flock of ſea-fowl, when the waves expel
   them from the ſhore. Their ſound was like a thouſand ſtreams that meet in Cona's vale, when after

   when virgins weep on the field !” Tall Morla came, the ſon of Swarth, and ſtately ſtrode the
   youth along ! He ſpoke to Erin's blue-eyed chief, among the leſſer heroes. “Take Swaran's peace,”
   the warrior ſpoke, “the peace he gives to kings, when nations bow to his ſword. Leave Erin's
   ſtreamy plains to us, and give thy ſpouſe and dog. Thy ſpouſe high-boſom'd, heaving fair ! Thy
   dog that overtakes the wind ! Give theſe to prove the weakneſs of thine arm ; live then beneath
   our power ! ”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Tell</hi> Swaran, tell that heart of pride, Cuthullin never yields. I give him
   the dark rolling ſea; I give his people graves in Erin. But never ſhall a ſtranger have the

   “Vain ruler of the car,” ſaid Morla,“wilt thou then fight the king ? The king whoſe ſhips of many

   He ſaw the death of his daughter: He roared in the midſt of thouſands. His ſpear met a ſon of
   Lochlin ; battle ſpreads from wing to wing ! As a hundred winds in Lochlin's groves ; as fire in
   the pines of a hundred hills; ſo loud, ſo ruinous, ſo vaſt the ranks of men are hewn down.
   Cuthullin cut off heroes like thiſtle ; Swaran waſted Erin. Curach fell by his hand, Cairbar
   
   <pb xml:id="P73110253" facs="../img/1773-790.pbm"/>
    of the boſſy ſhield ! Morglan lies in laſting reſt! Ca-olt
   trembles as he dies! His white breaſt is ſtained with blood ; his yellow hair ſtretched in the
   duſt of his native land ! He often had ſpread the feaſt where he fell. He often there had raiſed
   the voice of the harp: when his dogs leapt around for joy ; and the youths of the chace prepared
   the bow !</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Still</hi> Swaran advanced, as a ſtream, that burſts from the deſart. The little
   hills are rolled in its courſe ; the rocks are half-ſunk by its ſide! But Cuthullin ſtood before
   him, like a hill, that catches the clouds of heaven. The winds contend on its head of pines; the
   hail rattles on its rocks. But, firm in its ſtrength, it ſtands, and ſhades the ſilent vale of
   Cona ! So Cuthullin ſhaded the ſons of Erin, and ſtood in the midſt of thouſands. Blood riſes
   like the fount of a rock, from panting heroes around. But Erin falls on either wing, like ſnow in
   the day of the ſun.</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">O sons</hi> of Erin,” ſaid Grumal, “Lochlin conquers on the field. Why ſtrive we
   as reeds againſt the wind? Fly to the hill of dark-brown hinds.” He fled like the flag of Morven;
   his ſpear is a trembling beam of light behind him. Few fled with Grumal, chief of the little ſoul
   ; they fell in the battle of heroes, on Lena's 
   <pb xml:id="P73110254" facs="../img/1773-793.pbm"/>
    ecchoing heath. High on his car, of many gems, the chief of Erin
   ſtood. He ſlew a mighty ſon of Lochlin, and ſpoke, in haſte, to Connal. “O Connal, firſt of
   mortal men, thou haſt taught this arm of death ! Though Erin's ſons have fled, ſhall we not fight
   the foe? Carril, ſon of other times, carry my friends to that buſhy hill. Here, Connal, let us
   ſtand, like rocks, and ſave our flying friends.”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Connal</hi> mounts the car of gems. They ſtretch their ſhields, like the darkened
   moon, the daughter of the ſtarry ſkies, when ſhe moves, a dun circle, thro' heaven; and dreadful
   change is expected by men. Sithfadda panted up the hill, and Sronnal haughty ſteed. Like waves
   behind a whale behind them ruſhed the foe. Now on the riſing ſide of Cromla ſtood Erin's few ſad
   ſons; . like a grove through which the flame had ruſhed, hurried on by the winds of the ſtormy
   night; diſtant, withered, dark they ſtand, with not a leaf to ſhake in the gale.</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cuthullin</hi> ſtood beſide an oak. He rolled his red eye in ſilence, and heard
   the wind in his buſhy hair ; the ſcout of ocean came, Moran the ſon of Fithil. “The ſhips,” he
   cried,“the ſhips of the lonely iſles. Fingal comes the firſt of men, the breaker of the ſhields!
   The waves foam before his black prows ! His maſts with 
   <pb xml:id="P73110255" facs="../img/1773-796.pbm"/>
    ſails are like groves in clouds !” “Blow,” ſaid Cuthullin,
   “blow ye winds that ruſh along my iſle of miſt. Come to the death of thouſands, O king of
   reſounding Selma ! Thy ſails, my friend, are to me the clouds of the morning; thy ſhips the light
   of heaven ; and thou thyſelf a pillar of fire that beams on the world by night. O Connal, firſt
   of men, how pleaſing, in grief, are our friends! But the night is gathering around ! Where now
   are the ſhips of Fingal ? Here let us paſs the hours of darkneſs; here wiſh for the moon of
   heaven.”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> winds come down on the woods. The torrents ruſh from the rocks. Rain
   gathers round the head of Cromla, The red ſtars tremble between the flying clouds. Sad, by the
   ſide of a ſtream whoſe ſound is ecchoed by a tree, ſad by the ſide of a ſtream the chief of Erin
   ſits. Connal ſon of Colgar is there, and Carril of other times. “Unhappy is the hand of

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Deugala</hi> was the ſpouſe of Cairbar, chief of the plains of Ullin. She was
   covered with the light of beauty, but her heart was the houſe of pride. She loved that ſun-beam
   of youth, the ſon of noble Damman. Cairbar, ſaid the whitearmed Deugala, give me half of the
   herd. No more I will remain in your halls. Divide the herd, dark Cairbar! “Let Cuthullin,” ſaid
   Cairbar, “divide my herd on the hill. His breaſt is the ſeat of juſtice, Depart, thou light of

   The wrath of Deugala roſe !</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Son</hi> of Damman,” begun the fair, “Cuthullin hath pained my ſoul. I muſt hear
   of his death, or Lubar's ſtream ſhall roll over me. My pale ghoſt ſhall wander near thee, and

   “Deugala,” ſaid the fair-haired youth, “how ſhall I ſlay the ſon of Semo ? He is the friend of my

   three days before the chief, on the fourth he ſaid he would fight. “I will fight my friend,
   Deugala ! but may I fall by his ſword ! Could I wander on the hill alone ? Could I behold the
   grave of Cuthullin ?” We fought on the plain of Muri. Our ſwords avoid a wound. They ſlide on the
   helmets of ſteel ; or ſound on the ſlippery ſhields. Deugala was near with a ſmile, and ſaid to
   the ſon of Damman : “Thine arm is feeble, ſun-beam of youth ! Thy years are not ſtrong for ſteel.
   Yield to the ſon of Semo. He is a rock on Malmor.” </p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> tear is in the eye of youth. He faultering ſaid to me: “Cuthullin,

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Comal</hi> was a ſon of Albion ; the chief of an hundred hills! His deer drunk of
   a thouſand ſtreams. A thouſand rocks replied to the voice of his dogs. His face was the mildneſs
   of youth. His hand the death of heroes. One was his love, and fair was ſhe ! the daughter of
   mighty Conloch. She appeared like a ſun-beam among women. Her hair was the wing of the raven. Her
   dogs were taught to the chace. Her bowſtring ſounded on the winds. Her ſoul was fixed on Comal.
   Often met their eyes of love. Their courſe in the chace was one. Happy were their words in
   ſecret. But Grumal loved the maid, the dark chief of the gloomy Ardven. He watched her lone ſteps

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">One</hi> day, tired of the chace, when the miſt had concealed their friends,

   The arrow flew. Galbina fell in blood ! He run with wildneſs in his ſteps : he called the
   daughter of Conloch. No anſwer in the lonely rock. Where art thou, O my love? He ſaw, at length,

  <head>ARGUMENT to Book III.</head>
  <p> Cuthullin, pleaſed with the ſtory of Carril, inſiſts with that bard for more of his ſongs. He
   relates the actions of Fingal in Lochlin, and death of Agandecca the beautiful ſiſter of Swaran.
   He had ſcarce finiſhed when Calmar the ſon of Matha, who had adviſed the firſt battle, came
   wounded from the field, and told them of Swaran's deſign to ſurpriſe the remains of the Iriſh
   army. He himſelf propoſes to withſtand ſingly the whole force of the enemy, in a narrow paſs,
   till the Iriſh ſhould make good their retreat, Cuthullin, touched with the gallant propoſal of
   Calmar, reſolves to accompany him, and orders Carril to carry off the few that remained of the
   Iriſh. Morning comes, Calmar dies of his wounds ; and, the ſhips of the Caledonians appearing,
   Swaran gives over the purſuit of the Iriſh, and returns to oppoſe Fingal's landing. Cuthullin
   aſhamed, after his defeat, to appear before Fingal, retires to the cave of Tura. Fingal engages
   the enemy, puts them to flight; but the coming on of night makes the victory not deciſive, The
   King, who had obſerved the gallant behaviour of his grandſon Oſcar, gives him advices concerning
   his conduct in peace and war. He recommends to him to place the example of his fathers before his
   eyes, as the beſt model for his conduct ; which introduces the epiſode concerning Fainaſollis,
   the daughter of the king of Craca, whom Fingal had taken under his protection, in his youth.
   Fillan and Oſcar are diſpatched to obſerve the motions of the enemy by night ; Gaul the ſon of
   Morni deſires the command of the army, in the next battle; which Fingal promiſes to give him.
   Some general reflections of the poet cloſe the third day. </p>

   <p> The ſecond night, ſince the opening of the poem, continues ; and Cuthullin, Connal, and
     Carril ſtill ſit in the place deſcribed in the preceding book. The ſtory of Agandecca is
     introduced here with propriety, as great uſe is made of it in the courſe of the poem, and as
     it, in ſome meaſure, brings about the cataſtrophe. </p></note></p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Pleasant</hi> are the words of the ſong,” ſaid Cuthullin ! “lovely the tales of
   other times! They are, like the calm dew of the morning on the hill of roes; when the ſun is
   faint on its ſide, and the lake is ſettled and blue in the vale. O Carril, raiſe again thy voice
   ; let me hear the ſong of Selma : which was ſung in my halls of joy, when Fingal king of ſhields
   was there, and glowed at the deeds of his fathers.”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Fingal</hi>! thou dweller of battle,” ſaid Carril, “early were thy deeds in
   arms. Lochlin 
   <pb xml:id="P73110264" facs="../img/1773-821.pbm"/>
    was conſumed in thy wrath, when thy youth ſtrove with the
   beauty of maids. They ſmiled at the fair-blooming face of the hero; but death was in his hands.
   He was ſtrong as the waters of Lora. His followers were the roar of a thouſand ſtreams. They took
   the king of Lochlin in war; they reſtored him to his ſhips. His big heart ſwelled with pride ;
   the death of the youth was dark in his ſoul. For none ever, but Fingal, had overcome the ſtrength
   of the mighty Starno<note xmlns:t="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="bottom">
   <p> Starno was the father of Swaran as well as Agandecca. His fierce and cruel character is well
    marked in other poems concerning the times. </p>
   </note>. He ſat in the hall of his ſhells in Lochlin's woody land. He called the grey-haired
   Snivan, that often ſung round the circle<note xmlns:t="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="bottom">
   <p> This paſſage moſt certainly alludes to the religion of Lochlin, and <hi>the ſtone of

   </note> of Loda : when the ſtone of power heard his voice, and battle turned in the field of the
   valiant!</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Go</hi>; grey-haired Snivan,” Starno ſaid, “go to Ardven's ſea-ſurrounded rocks.
   Tell to the king of Selma; he the faireſt among his thouſands, tell him I give him my daughter,
   the lovelieſt maid, that ever heaved a breaſt of ſnow. Her arms are white as the foam of my
   waves. Her ſoul is generous and mild. Let him come with his braveſt heroes, to the daughter of
   the 
   <pb xml:id="P73110265" facs="../img/1773-824.pbm"/>
    ſecret hall!” Snivan came to Selma's hall : Fair-haired
   Fingal attended his ſteps. His kindled ſoul flew to the maid, as he bounded on the waves of the
   north. “Welcome,” ſaid the dark-brown Starno, “welcome, king of rocky Morven : Welcome his heroes
   of might ; ſons of the diftant iſle! Three days within my halls ſhall ye feaſt; three days purſue
   my boars; that your fame may reach the maid who dwells in the ſecret hall.”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Starno</hi> deſigned their death. He gave the feaſt of ſhells. Fingal, who
   doubted the foe, kept on his arms of ſteel. The ſons of death were afraid : They fled from the
   eyes of the king. The voice of ſprightly mirth aroſe. The trembling harps of joy were ſtrung.
   Bards ſung the battle of heroes: They ſung the heaving breaſt of love. Ullin, Fingal's bard, was
   there : the ſweet voice of reſounding Cona. He praiſed the daughter of Lochlin; and Morven's<note xmlns:t="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="bottom">

   </note> high-deſcended chief. The daughter of Lochlin overheard. She left the hall of her ſecret
   ſigh ! She came in all her beauty, like the moon from the cloud of the eaſt. Lovelineſs was
   around her as light. Her ſteps were the muſic of ſongs. She 
   <pb xml:id="P73110266" facs="../img/1773-827.pbm"/>
    ſaw the youth and loved him. He was the ſtolen ſigh of her
   ſoul. Her blue eye rolled on him in ſecret : ſhe bleſt the chief of reſounding Morven.</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> third day with all its beams, ſhone bright on the wood of boars. Forth
   moved the dark-browed Starno; and Fingal, king of ſhields. Half the day they ſpent in the chace ;
   the ſpear of Selma was red in blood. It was then the daughter of Starno, with blue eyes rolling
   in tears; it was then ſhe came with her voice of love and ſpoke to the king of Norven. “Fingal,
   high deſcended chief, truſt not Starno's heart of pride. Within that wood he has placed his
   chiefs. Beware of the wood of death. But, remember, ſon of the iſle, remember Agandecca : ſave me
   from the wrath of my father, king of the windy Morven !”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> youth, with unconcern, went on ; his heroes by his ſide. The ſons of
   death fell by his hand; and Gormal ecchoed around ! Before the halls of Starno the ſons of the
   chace convened. The king's dark brows were like clouds. His eyes like meteors of night. “Bring
   hither,” he ſaid, “Agandecca to her lovely king of Morven ! His hand is ſtained with the blood of
   my people ; her words have not been in vain !” She came with the red eye of tears. She came
   
   <pb xml:id="P73110267" facs="../img/1773-830.pbm"/>
    with looſely flowing locks. Her white breaſt heaved with
   broken ſighs, like the foam of the ſtreamy Lubar. Starno pierced her ſide with ſteel. She fell,
   like a wreath of ſnow, which ſlides from the rocks of Ronan ; when the woods are ſtill, and eccho
   deepens in the vale ! Then Fingal eyed his valiant chiefs, his valiant Chiefs took arms. The
   gloom of battle roared ; Lochlin fled or died. Pale, in his bounding ſhip he cloſed the maid of
   the ſofteſt ſoul. Her tomb aſcends on Ardven; the ſea roars round her narrow dwelling.</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Blessed</hi> be her ſoul,” ſaid Cuthullin ; “bleſſed be the mouth of the ſong!
   Strong was the youth of Fingal; ſtrong is his arm of age. Lochlin ſhall fall again before the

   <p> This is the only paſſage in the poem that has the appearance of religion. But Cuthullin's
    apoſtrophe to this ſpirit is accompanied with a doubt, ſo that it is not eaſy to determine
    whether the hero meant a ſuperior being, or the ghoſts of deceaſed warriors, who were ſuppoſed

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Such</hi> were the words of Cuthullin at the ſound of the mountain-ſtream ; when
   Calmar aſcended the hill, the wounded ſon of Matha. From the field he came in his blood. He
   leaned on his bending ſpear. Feeble is the arm of battle ! but ſtrong the ſoul of the hero
   “Welcome! O ſon of Matha,” ſaid Connal, “welcome art thou to thy friends ! Why burſts that broken
   ſigh, from the breaſt of him who never feared before? And never, Connal, will he fear, chief of
   the pointed ſteel! My ſoul brightens in danger: in the noiſe of arms. I am of the race of battle.
   My fathers never feared.”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Cormar</hi> was the firſt of my race. He ſported through the ſtorms of waves.
   His black ſkiff bounded on ocean; he travelled on the wings of the wind. A ſpirit once embroiled
   the night. Seas ſwell and rocks reſound. Winds drive along the clouds. The lightning flies on
   wings of fire. He feared and came to land: then bluſhed that he feared at all. He ruſhed again
   among the waves to find the ſon of the wind. Three youths guide the bounding bark ; he ſtood with
   ſword unſheathed. When the low-hung vapour paſſed, he took it by the curling head. He ſearched
   its dark womb with

    his ſteel. The ſon of the wind forſook the air. The moon and
   ſtars returned ! Such was the boldneſs of my race. Calmar is like his fathers. Danger flies from
   the lifted ſword. They beſt ſucceed who dare !”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">But</hi> now, ye ſons of green Erin, retire from Lena's bloody heath. Collect the
   ſad remnant of our friends, and join the ſword of Fingal. I heard the ſound of Lochlin's
   advancing arms ! Calmar will remain and fight. My voice ſhall be ſuch, my friends, as if
   thouſands were behind me. But, ſon of Semo, remember me. Remember Calmar's lifeleſs corſe. When
   Fingal ſhall have waſted the field, place me by ſome ſtone of remembrance, that future times may
   hear my fame ; that the mother of Calmar may rejoice in my renown.”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">No</hi>: ſon of Matha,” ſaid Cuthullin, “I will never leave thee here. My joy is
   in unequal fight: my ſoul increaſes in danger. Connal, and Carril of other times, carry off the
   ſad ſons of Erin. When the battle is over, ſearch for us in this narrow way. For near this oak we
   ſhall fall, in the ſtream of the battle of thouſands !” O Fithil's ſon, with flying ſpeed ruſh
   over the heath of Lena. Tell to Fingal that Erin is fallen. Bid the king of Morven come. O let

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Morning</hi> is grey on Cromla. The ſons of the ſea aſcend. Calmar ſtood forth to
   meet them in the pride of his kindling ſoul. But pale was the face of the chief. He leaned on his
   father's ſpear. That ſpear which he brought from Lara, when the ſoul of his mother was ſad ; the
   ſoul of the lonely Alcletha, waining in the ſorrow of years. But ſlowly now the hero falls, like
   a tree on the plain. Dark Cuthullin ſtands alone like a rock in a ſandy vale. The ſea comes with
   its waves, and roars on its hardened ſides. Its head is covered with foam ; the hills are
   ecchoing around.</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Now</hi> from the grey miſt of the ocean, the white-ſailed ſhips of Fingal
   appear. High is the grove of their maſts, as they nod, by turns, on the rolling wave. Swaran ſaw
   them from the hill. He returned from the ſons of Erin. As ebbs the reſounding ſea, through the
   hundred iſles of Iniſtore; ſo loud, ſo vaſt, ſo immenſe returned the ſons of Lochlin againſt the
   king. But bending, weeping, ſad, and ſlow, and dragging his long ſpear behind, Cuthullin ſunk in
   Cromla's wood, and mourned his fallen friends. He feared the face of Fingal, who was wont to
   greet him from the fields of renown !

    “<hi rend="smallcaps">How</hi> many lie there of my heroes! the

   No more ſhall I find their ſteps in the heath. No more ſhall I hear their voice in the chace.
   Pale, ſilent, low on bloody beds, are they who were my friends! O ſpirits of the lately dead,
   meet Cuthullin on his heath. Speak to him on the wind, when the ruſtling tree of Tura's cave
   reſounds. There, far remote, I ſhall lie unknown. No bard ſhall hear of me. No grey tone ſhall
   riſe to my renown. Mourn me with the dead, O Bragela ! departed is my fame.” Such were the words
   of Cuthullin, when he ſunk in the woods of Cromla !</p>

   was the gleam of the ſteel : it was like the green meteor of death, ſetting in the heath of
   Malmor, when the traveller is alone, and the broad moon is darkened in heaven.</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> battle is paſt,” ſaid the king, “I behold the blood of my friends. Sad
   is the heath of Lena! mournful the oaks of Cromla. The hunters have fallen in their ſtrength :
   the ſon of Semo is no more. Ryno and Fillan, my ſons, ſound the horn of Fingal. Aſcend that hill

    Call them from the grave of Lamdarg, the chief of other

   roaring eddy of ocean returning from the kingdom of ſnows; ſo ſtrong, ſo dark, ſo ſudden came
   down the ſons of Lochlin. The king in their front appears, in the diſmal pride of his arms !
   Wrath burns on his dark-brown face : his eyes roll in the fire of his valour. Fingal beheld the
   ſon of Starno: he remembered Agandecca. For Swaran with the tears of youth had mourned his
   white-boſomed ſiſter. He ſent Ullin of ſongs to bid him to the feaſt of ſhells : For pleaſant on
   Fingal's ſoul returned the memory of the firſt of his loves !</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ullin</hi> came with aged ſteps, and ſpoke to Starno's ſon. “O thou that dwelleſt

   “we break the ecchoing ſhields: to-morrow my feaſt ſhall be ſpread ; but Fingal ſhall lie on

   ſhall break the ecchoing ſhields. Oſſian, ſtand thou near my arm. Gaul, lift thy terrible ſword.
   Fergus, bend thy crooked yew. Throw, Fillan, thy lance through heaven. Lift your ſhields, like

   the hills: it was like the thunder of night, when the cloud burſts on Cona ; and a thouſand
   ghoſts ſhriek at once on the hollow wind. Fingal ruſhed on in his ſtrength, terrible as the
   ſpirit of Trenmor; when, in a whirlwind, he comes to Morven, to ſee the children of his pride.
   The oaks reſound on their mountains, and the rocks fall down before him. Dimly ſeen, as

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ryno</hi> went on like a pillar of fire. Dark is the brow of Gaul. Fergus ruſhed
   forward with feet of wind. Fillan like the miſt of the hill. Oſſian, like a rock, came down. I

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Who</hi> can relate the deaths of the people ? Who the deeds of mighty heroes ?
   when Fingal, burning in his wrath, conſumed the ſons of Lochlin? groans ſwelled on groans from
   hill to hill, till night had covered all. Pale, ſtaring like a herd of deer, the ſons of Lochlin
   convene on Lena. We ſat and heard the ſprightly harp, at Lubar's gentle ſtream. Fingal himſelf
   was next to the foe. He liſtened to the tales of his bards. His godlike race were in the ſong,
   the chiefs of other times. Attentive, leaning on his ſhield, the king of Morven ſat. The wind
   whiſtled through his locks; his thoughts are of 
   <pb xml:id="P73110275" facs="../img/1773-854.pbm"/>
    the days of other years. Near him on his bending ſpear, my

  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Son</hi> of my ſon,” begun the king, “O Oſcar, pride of youth ! I ſaw the

    few were in my train: A white-ſailed boat appeared far off;
   we ſaw it like a miſt, that rode on ocean's wind. It ſoon approached. We ſaw the fair. Her white
   breaſt heaved with ſighs, The wind was in her looſe dark hair : her roſy cheek had tears.
   “Daughter of beauty,” calm I ſaid, “what ſigh is in thy breaſt? Can I, young as I am, defend
   thee, daughter of the ſea? My ſword is not unmatched in war, but dauntleſs is my heart.”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">To</hi> thee I fly,” with ſighs ſhe ſaid, “O prince of mighty men! To thee I

   Fainaſóllis ! Sora's chief beheld me fair; he loved the daughter of Craca. His ſword is a beam of
   light upon the warrior's ſide. But dark is his brow ; and tempeſts are in his ſoul. I ſhun him,
   on the roaring ſea ; but Sora's chief purſues.”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Rest</hi> thou,” I ſaid, “behind my ſhield; reſt in peace, thou beam of light!
   The gloomy chief of Sora will fly, if Fingal's arm is like his ſoul. In ſome lone cave I might

   afar, appeared the ſhip of ſtormy Borbar. His maſts high-bended over the ſea behind their ſheets
   of ſnow. White roll the waters on either ſide. The ſtrength of ocean ſounds. “Come thou,” I ſaid,
   “from the roar of ocean, thou rider of the ſtorm ! Partake the feaſt within my hall. It is the

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> maid ſtood trembling by my ſide. He drew the bow. She fell. “Unerring is
   thy hand,” I ſaid, “but feeble was the foe!” We fought, nor weak the ſtrife of death! He ſank

   <p> Gaul, the ſon of Morni, was chief of a tribe that diſputed long, the pre-eminence, with

    hero of more ſtrength than conduct in battle. He was very fond of military fame, and here he
    demands the next battle to himſelf. The poet, by an artifice, removes Fingal, that his return
    may be the more magnificent. </p>

  <head>ARGUMENT to Book IV.</head>
  <p> The action of the poem being ſuſpended by night, Oſſian takes that opportunity to relate his
   own actions at the lake of Lego, and his courtſhip of Evirallin, who was the mother of Oſcar, and
   had died ſome time before the expedition of Fingal into Ireland. Her ghoſt appears to him, and
   tells him that Oſcar, who had been ſent, the beginning of the night, to obſerve the enemy, was
   engaged with an advanced party, and almoſt overpowered. Oſſian relieves his ſon; and an alarm is
   given to Fingal of the approach of Swaran. The king riſes, calls his army together, and, as he
   had promiſed the preceding night, devolves the command on Gaul the ſon of Morni, while he
   himſelf, after charging his ſons to behave gallantly and defend his people, retires to a hill,
   from whence he could have a view of the battle. The battle joins; the poet relates Oſcar's great
   actions. But when Oſcar, in conjunction with his father, conquered in one wing, Gaul, who was
   attacked by Swaran in perſon, was on the point of retreating in the other. Fingal ſends Ullin his
   bard to encourage him with a war ſong, but notwithſtanding Swaran prevails; and Gaul and his army
   are obliged to give way. Fingal, deſcending from the hill, rallies them again: Swaran deſiſts
   from the purſuit, poſſeſſes himſelf of a riſing ground, reſtores the ranks, and waits the
   approach of Fingal. The king, having encouraged his men, gives the neceſſary orders, and renews
   the battle. Cuthullin, who, with his friend Connal, and Carril his bard, had retired to the cave
   of Tura, hearing the noiſe, came to the brow of the hill, which overlooked the field of battle,
   where he ſaw Fingal engaged with the enemy. He, being hindered by Connal from joining Fingal, who
   was himſelf upon the point of obtaining a complete victory, ſends Carril to congratulate that
   hero on his ſucceſs. </p>

  <head>FINGAL, AN ANCIENT EPIC POEM. In SIX BOOKS, BOOK IV.</head>
  <p><note xmlns:t="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="bottom">
   <p>Fingal being aſleep, and the action ſuſpended by night, the poet introduces the ſtory of his
    courtſhip of Evirallin the daughter of Branno, The epiſode is neceſſary to clear up ſeveral
    paſſages that follow in the poem; at the ſame time that it naturally brings on the action of the
    book, which may be ſuppoſed to begin about the middle of the third night from the opening of the
    poem. This book, as many of Oſſian's other compoſitions, is addreſſed to the beautiful Malvina
    the daughter of Toſcar. She appears to have been in love with Oſcar, and to have affected the
    company of the father after the death of the ſon. </p>
   </note> <hi rend="smallcaps">Who</hi> comes with her ſongs from the hill, like the bow of the ſhowery
   Lena? It is the maid of the voice of love ! The white-armed daughter of Toſcar ! Often haſt thou
   heard my ſong; often given the tear of beauty. Doſt thou come to the wars of thy people? to hear
   
   <pb xml:id="P73110284" facs="../img/1773-879.pbm"/>
    the actions of Oſcar ? When ſhall I ceaſe to mourn, by the
   ſtreams of reſounding Cona ? My years have paſſed away in battle. My age is darkened with
   grief!</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Daughter</hi> of the hand of ſnow! I was not ſo mournful and blind. I was not ſo
   dark and forlorn, when Everallin loved me ! Everallin with the dark-brown hair, the white-boſomed
   daughter of Branno! A thouſand heroes ſought the maid, ſhe refuſed her love to a thouſand. The
   ſons of the ſword were deſpiſed : for graceful in her eyes was Oſſian! I went, in ſuit of the
   maid, to Lego's ſable ſurge. Twelve of my people were there, the ſons of ſtreamy Morven ! We came
   to Branno, friend of ſtrangers! Branno of the ſounding mail! “From whence,” he ſaid, “are the
   arms of ſteel? Not eaſy to win is the maid, who has denied the blue-eyed ſons of Erin ! But bleſt
   be thou, O ſon of Fingal! Happy is the maid that waits thee! Tho' twelve daughters of beauty were
   mine, thine were the choice, thou ſon of fame !”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi> opened the hall of the maid, the dark-haired Everallin. Joy kindled in
   our manly breaſts. We bleſt the maid of Branno. “Above us on the hill appeared the people of
   ſtately Cormac. Eight were the heroes of the chief. The heath flamed wide with their arms. There
   
   <pb xml:id="P73110285" facs="../img/1773-882.pbm"/>
    Colla ; there Durra of wounds, there mighty Toſcar, and Tago,
   there Freſtal the victorious ſtood ; Dairo of the happy deeds: Dala the battle's bulwark in the
   narrow way ! The ſword flamed in the hand of Cormac. Graceful was the look of the hero! Eight
   were the heroes of Oſſian. Ullin ſtormy ſon of-war. Mullo of the generous deeds. The noble, the
   graceful Scelacha, Oglan, and Cerdal the wrathful. Dumariccan's brows of death! And why ſhould
   Ogar be the laſt; ſo wide renowned on the hills of Ardven ?”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Ogar</hi> met Dala the ſtrong, face to face, on the field of heroes. The battle
   of the chiefs was, like wind, on ocean's foamy waves. The dagger is remembered by Ogar ; the
   weapon which he loved. Nine times he drowned it in Dela's ſide. The ſtormy battle turned. Three
   times I broke on Cormac's ſhield : three times he broke his ſpear. But, unhappy youth of love! I
   cut his head away. Five times I ſhook it by the lock. The friends of Cormac fled. Whoever would
   have told me, lovely maid, when then I ſtrove in battle; that blind, forſaken, and forlorn I now
   ſhould paſs the night; firm ought his mail to have been; unmatched his arm in war !”

   <p> The poet returns to his ſubject. If one could fix the time of the year in which the action of
    the poem happened, from the ſcene deſcribed here, I ſhould be tempted to place it in autumn. The
    trees ſhed their leaves, and the winds are variable, both which circumſtances agree with that
    ſeaſon of the year. </p>
   </note> Lena's gloomy heath, the voice of muſic died away. The unconſtant blaſt blew hard. The
   high oak ſhook its leaves around. Of Everallin were my thoughts, when in all the light of beauty
   ſhe came. Her blue eyes rolling in tears. She ſtood on a cloud before my ſight, and ſpoke with
   feeble voice ! “Riſe, Oſſian, riſe and ſave my ſon; ſave Oſcar prince of men. Near the red oak of
   Luba's ſtream, he fights with Lochlin's ſons.” She ſunk into her cloud again, I covered me with
   ſteel. My ſpear ſupported my ſteps; my rattling armour rung. I hummed, as I was wont in danger,
   the ſongs of heroes of old. Like diſtant thunder Lochlin heard. They fled ; my ſon purſued.”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">I called</hi> him like a diſtant ſtream. Oſcar return over Lena. “No further
   purſue the foe,” I ſaid, “though Oſſian is behind thee.” He came ; and pleaſant to my ear was
   Oſcar's ſounding ſteel. “Why didſt thou ſtop my hand,” he ſaid, “till death had covered all ? For
   dark and dreadful by the ſtream they met 
   <pb xml:id="P73110287" facs="../img/1773-888.pbm"/>
    thy ſon and Fillan ! They watched the terrors of the night.
   Our ſwords have conquered ſome. But as the winds of night pour the ocean, over the white ſands of
   Mora, ſo dark advance the ſons of Lochlin, over Lena's ruſtling heath ! The ghoſts of night
   ſhriek afar: I have ſeen the meteors of death. Let me awake the king of Morven, he that ſmiles in
   danger ! He that is like the ſun of heaven, riſing in a ſtorm !”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fingal</hi> had ſtarted from a dream, and leaned on Trenmor's ſhield ; the
   dark-brown ſhield of his fathers ; which they had lifted of old in war. The hero had ſeen, in his
   reſt, the mournful form of Agandecca. She came from the way of the ocean. She ſlowly, lonely,
   moved over Lena. Her face was pale like the miſt of Cromla. Dark were the tears of her cheek. She
   often raiſed her dim hand from her robe: her robe which was of the clouds of the deſart: ſhe
   raiſed her dim hand over Fingal, and turned away her ſilent eyes! “Why weeps the daughter of
   Starno ?” ſaid Fingal, with a ſigh; “why is thy face ſo pale, fair wanderer of the clouds ?” She
   departed: on the wind of Lena. She left him in the midſt of the night. She mourned the ſons of
   her people, that were to fall by the hand of Fingal.</p>

   <pb xml:id="P73110288" facs="../img/1773-891.pbm"/>
    <hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> hero ſtarted from reſt. Still he beheld
   her in his ſoul. The ſound of Oſcar's ſteps approached. The king ſaw the grey ſhield on his ſide
   : For the faint beam of the morning came over the waters of Ullin. “What do the foes in their
   fear ?” ſaid the riſing king of Morven ; “or fly they through ocean's foam, or wait they the
   battle of ſteel? But why ſhould Fingal aſk ? I hear their voice on the early wind ! Fly over
   Lena's heath : O Oſcar, awake our friends !”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> king ſtood by the ſtone of Lubar. Thrice he reared his terrible voice.
   The deer ſtarted from the fountains of Cromla. The rocks ſhook on all their hills. Like the noiſe

   tempeſt on the blue face of the ſky ! ſo met the ſons of the deſart, round the terrible voice of
   Fingal. Pleaſant was the voice of the king of Morven to the warriors of his land. Often had he
   led them to battle ; often returned with the ſpoils of the foe !</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Come</hi> to battle,” ſaid the king, “ye children of ecchoing Selma ! Come to
   the death of thouſands. Comhal's ſon will ſee the fight. My ſword ſhall wave on the hill the

   And may the blaſt of Lena carry them over my ſeas, that they may come to my ſilent dreams, and

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Now</hi> like a dark and ſtormy cloud, edged round with the red lightning of
   heaven ; flying weſtward from the morning's beam, the king of Selma removed. Terrible is the

   back on the war. Three bards attend the ſon of fame, to bear his words to the chiefs. High on

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Joy</hi> riſes in Oſcar's face. His cheek is red. His eye ſheds tears. The ſword

   ſteel! my father, hear thy ſon! Retire with Morven's mighty chief. Give me the fame of Oſſian. If
   here I fall : O chief, remember that breaſt of ſnow, the lonely ſun-beam of my love, the
   white-handed daughter of Toſcar ! For, with red cheek from the rock, bending over the ſtream, her
   ſoft hair flies about her boſom, as ſhe pours the ſigh for Oſcar. Tell her I am on my hills, a
   lightly-bounding ſon of the wind; tell her, that in a cloud, I may meet the lovely maid of

   ſound, and warriors fall. As a hundred hammers on the red ſon of the furnace, ſo roſe, ſo rung
   their ſwords !</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gaul</hi> ruſhed on, like a whirlwind in Ardven. The deſtruction of heroes is on

   to the ſong the death of many ſpears? My ſword roſe high, and flamed in the ſtrife of blood.
   Oſcar, terrible wert thou, my beſt, my greateſt ſon! I rejoiced in my ſecret ſoul, when his ſword
   flamed over the ſlain. They fled amain through Lena's heath. We purſued and ſlew. As ſtones that

   crowded waves : when the dark wind blows from the deep, and rolls the billows through the ſandy
   vale! Cuthullin kindled at the ſight. Darkneſs gathered on his brow. His hand is on the ſword of

  <head>ARGUMENT to Book V</head>
  <p> Cuthullin and Connal ſtill remain on the hill. Fingal and Swaran meet; the combat is
   deſcribed. Swaran is overcome, bound and delivered over as a priſoner to the care of Oſſian and
   Gaul the ſon of Morni ; Fingal, his younger ſons, and Oſcar, ſtill purſue the enemy. The epiſode
   of Orla a Chief of Lochlin, who was mortally wounded in the battle, is introduced. Fingal,
   touched with the death of Orla, orders the purſuit to be diſcontinued; and calling his ſons
   together, he is informed that Ryno, the youngeſt of them, was ſlain. He laments his death, hears
   the ſtory of Lamdarg and Gelchoſſa, and returns towards the place where he had left Swaran.
   Carril, who had been ſent by Cuthullin to congratulate Fingal on his victory, comes in the mean
   time to Oſſian. The converſation of the two poets cloſes the action of the fourth day. </p>

  <p> <hi rend="smallcaps">On</hi> Cromla's reſounding ſide, Connal ſpoke to the chief of the noble car.
   Why that gloom, ſon of Semo? Our friends are the mighty in fight. Renowned art thou, O warrior !
   many were the deaths of thy ſteel. Often has Bragela met, with blue-rolling eyes of joy : often
   has ſhe met her hero, returning in the midſt of the valiant; when his ſword was red with
   ſlaughter ; when his foes were ſilent in the fields of the tomb. Pleaſant to her ears were thy
   bards, when thy deeds aroſe in ſong.</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">But</hi> behold the king of Morven! He moves, below, like a pillar of fire. His
   ſtrength is like the ſtream of Lubar, or the wind of the ecchoing Cromla ; when the branchy
   foreſts of night are 
   <pb xml:id="P73110302" facs="../img/1773-931.pbm"/>
    torn from all their rocks! Happy are thy people, O Fingal!
   thine arm ſhall finiſh their wars. Thou art the firſt in their dangers : the wiſeſt in the days
   of their peace. Thou ſpeakeſt and thy thouſands obey : armies tremble at the ſound of thy ſteel.
   Happy are thy people, O Fingal, king of reſounding Selma ! Who is that ſo dark and terrible
   coming in the thunder of his courſe? who but Starno's ſon to meet the king of Morven? Behold the
   battle of the chiefs ! it is the ſtorm of the ocean, when two ſpirits meet far diſtant, and
   contend for the rolling of waves. The hunter hears the noiſe on his hill. He ſees the high
   billows advancing to Ardven's ſhore !</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Such</hi> were the words of Connal, when the heroes met, in fight. There was the
   clang of arms ! there every blow, like the hundred hammers of the furnace ! Terrible is the
   battle of the Kings; dreadful the look of their eyes. Their dark-brown ſhields are cleft in
   twain. Their ſteel flies, broken, from their helms. They fling their weapons down. Each ruſhes to
   his hero's graſp: Their ſinewy arms bend round each other: they turn from ſide to ſide, and train
   and ſtretch their large ſpreading limbs below. But when the pride of their ſtrength aroſe, they
   ſhook the hill with their heels. 
   <pb xml:id="P73110303" facs="../img/1773-934.pbm"/>
    Rocks tumble from their places on high; the green-headed
   buſhes are overturned. At length the ſtrength of Swaran fell: the king of the groves is bound.
   Thus have I ſeen on Cona ; but Cona I behold no more ! thus have I ſeen two dark hills, removed
   from their place, by the ſtrength of the burſting ſtream. They turn from ſide to ſide in their
   fall; their tall oaks meet one another on high. Then they tumble together with all their rocks
   and trees. The ſtreams are turned by their ſide. The red ruin is ſeen afar.</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Sons</hi> of diſtant Morven,” ſaid Fingal : “guard the king of Lochlin. He is
   ſtrong as his thouſand waves. His hand is taught to war. His race is of the times of old. Gaul,
   thou firſt of my heroes; Oſſian king of ſongs, attend. He is the friend of Agandecca ; raiſe to
   joy his grief. But, Oſcar, Fillan, and Ryno, ye children of the race ! purſue Lochlin over Lena;
   that no veſſel may hereafter bound, on the dark-rolling waves of Iniſtore !</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">They</hi> flew ſudden acroſs the heath. He ſlowly moved, like a cloud of thunder,
   when the ſultry plain of ſummer is ſilent and dark! His ſword is before him as a ſun-beam ;
   terrible as the ſtreaming meteor of night. He came toward a chief of Lochlin. He ſpoke to the
   
   <pb xml:id="P73110304" facs="../img/1773-937.pbm"/>
    ſon of the wave. “Who is that ſo dark and ſad, at the rock of
   the roaring ſtream ? He cannot bound over its courſe: How ſtately is the chief! His boſſy ſhield
   is on his ſide; his ſpear, like the tree of the deſart! Youth of the dark-red hair, art thou of
   the foes of Fingal ?”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">I am</hi> a ſon of Lochlin,” he cries, “ſtrong is my arm in war. My ſpouſe is
   weeping at home. Orla ſhall never return !” “Or fights or yields the hero,” ſaid Fingal of the
   noble deeds? “foes do not conquer in my preſence : my friends are renowned in the hall. Son of
   the wave, follow me, partake the feaſt of my ſhells: purſue the deer of my deſart: be thou the
   friend of Fingal.” “No:” ſaid the hero, “I aſſiſt the feeble. My ſtrength is with the weak in
   arms. My ſword has been always unmatched, O warrior : let the king of Morven yield!” “I never
   yielded, Orla, Fingal never yielded to man. Draw thy ſword aud chuſe thy foe. Many are my heroes
   !”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Does</hi> then the king refuſe the fight,” ſaid Orla of the dark-brown ſhield ?
   “Fingal is a match for Orla : and he alone of all his race !” “But, king of Morven, if I ſhall
   fall; as one time the warrior muſt die ; raiſe my tomb in the midſt : let it be the greateſt on
   Lena. Send, over the dark-blue wave, the ſword of Orla to 
   <pb xml:id="P73110305" facs="../img/1773-940.pbm"/>
    the ſpouſe of his love; that ſhe may ſhew it to her ſon, with
   tears, to kindle his ſoul to war.” “Son of the mournful tale,” ſaid Fingal, “why doſt thou awaken
   my tears? One day the warriors muſt die, and the children ſee their uſeleſs arms in the hall.
   But, Orla, thy tomb ſhall riſe. Thy white-boſomed ſpouſe ſhall weep over thy ſword.”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">They</hi> fought on the heath of Lena. Feeble was the arm of Orla. The ſword of
   Fingal deſcended, and cleft his ſhield in twain. It fell and glittered on the ground, as the moon
   on the ruffled ſtream. “King of Morven,” ſaid the hero, “lift thy ſword and pierce my breaſt,
   Wounded and faint from battle, my friends have left me here. The mournful tale ſhall come to my
   love, on the banks of the ſtreamy Lota ; when ſhe is alone in the wood; and the ruſtling blaſt in
   the leaves !”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">No</hi>;” ſaid the king of Morven, “I will never wound thee, Orla. On the banks
   of Lota let her ſee thee, eſcaped from the hands of war. Let thy grey-haired father, who,
   perhaps, is blind with age. Let him hear the ſound of thy voice, and brighten within his hall.
   With joy let the hero riſe, and ſearch for his ſon with his hands !” “But never will he find him,
   Fingal;” ſaid the youth of the ſtreamy Lota. “On 
   <pb xml:id="P73110306" facs="../img/1773-943.pbm"/>
    Lena's heath I muſt die : foreign bards ſhall talk of me. My
   broad belt covers my wound of death. I give it to the wind!”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> dark blood poured from his ſide, he fell pale on the heath of Lena.
   Fingal bent over him as he dies, and called his younger chiefs. “Oſcar and Fillan, my ſons, raiſe
   high the memory of Orla. Here let the dark-haired hero reſt, far from the ſpouſe of his love.
   Here let him reſt in his narrow houſe far from the ſound of Lota. The feeble will find his bow at
   home; but will not be able to bend it. His faithful dogs howl on his hills ; his boars, which he
   uſed to purſue, rejoice. Fallen is the arm of battle ! the mighty among the valiant is low !”
   “Exalt the voice, and blow the horn, ye ſons of the king of Morven ! Let us go back to Swaran, to
   ſend the night away on ſong. Fillan, Oſcar, and Ryno, fly over the heath of Lena. Where, Ryno,
   art thou, young ſon of fame? Thou art not wont to be the laſt to anſwer thy father's voice !”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Ryno</hi>,” ſaid Ullin firſt of bards, “is with the awful forms of his fathers.
   With Trathal king of ſhields; with Trenumor of mighty deeds. The youth is low, the youth is pale,
   he lies on Lena's heath !” “Fell the ſwifteſt in the race,” ſaid the king, “the firſt to bend the
   bow ? 
   <pb xml:id="P73110307" facs="../img/1773-946.pbm"/>
    Thou ſcarce haſt been known to me? why did young Ryno fall?
   But ſleep thou ſoftly on Lena, Fingal ſhall ſoon behold thee. Soon ſhall my voice be heard no
   more, and my footſteps ceaſe to be ſeen. The bards will tell of Fingal's name. The ſtones will
   talk of me. But, Ryno, thou art low indeed ! thou haſt not received thy fame. Ullin, ſtrike the
   harp for Ryno; tell what the chief would have been. Farewel, thou firſt in every field ! No more
   ſhall I direct thy dart ! Thou that haſt been ſo fair ! I behold thee not. Farewel.” The tear is
   on the cheek of the king, for terrible was his ſon in war. His ſon! that was like a beam of fire
   by night on a hill; when the foreſts ſink down in its courſe, and the traveller trembles at the
   ſound! But the winds drive it beyond the ſteep. It ſinks from ſight, and darkneſs prevails,</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Whose</hi> fame is in that dark-green tomb,” begun the king of generous ſhells ?
   “four ſtones with their heads of moſs ſtand there! They mark the narrow houſe of death. Near it
   let Ryno reſt. A neighbour to the brave let him lie. Some chief of fame is here, to fly, with my

   battle, is not here. He fights Ulfada mighty chief. He is not here, thou firſt of men! But
   Lamderg never yields. He will fight the ſon of Cairbar!” “Lovely art thou,” ſaid terrible
   Ullin,“daughter of the generous Tuathal. I carry thee to Cairbar's halls. The valiant ſhall have
   Gelchoſſa. Three days I remain on Cramla, to wait that ſon of battle, Lamderg. On the fourth
   Gelchoſſa is mine; if the mighty Lamderg flies.”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Allad</hi> !” ſaid the chief of Cromla, “peace to thy dreams in the cave.
   Ferchios, ſound the horn of Lamderg, that Ullin may hear in his halls. Lamderg, like a roaring
   ſtorm, aſcended the hill from Tura. He hummed a ſurly ſong as he went, like the noiſe of a
   falling ſtream, He darkly ſtood upon the hill, like a cloud varying its form to the wind, He
   rolled a ſtone, the ſign of war. Ullin heard in Cairbar's hall. The hero heard, with joy, his
   foe. He took his father's ſpear. A ſmile brightens his dark-brown cheek, as he places his ſword
   by his ſide. The dagger glittered in his hand. He whiſtled as he went.

   Cromla. I ſee the darkbrown hinds!” She haſted up the hill. In vain! the gloomy heroes fought.
   Why ſhould I tell to Selma's king, how wrathful heroes fight? Fierce Ullin fell. Young Lamderg
   came, all pale to the daughter of generous Tuathal ! “What blood, my love, she trembling ſaid ?
   what blood runs down my warrior's ſide ?” “It is Ullin's blood, the chief replied, thou fairer
   than the ſnow ! Gelchoſſa, let me reſt here a little while. The mighty Lamderg died !” “And

   lies acroſs a ſtream, and withers in the wind. Oſcar ! chief of every youth! thou ſeeſt how they
   have fallen. Be thou like them, on earth renowned. Like them the ſong of bards. Terrible were
   their forms in battle ; but calm was Ryno in the days of peace. He was like the bow of the ſhower
   ſeen far diſtant on the ſtream ; when the ſun is ſetting on Mora; when ſilence dwells on the hill
   of deer. Reſt, youngeſt of my ſons! reſt, O Ryno, on Lena. We too ſhall be no more. Warriors one

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Such</hi> was thy grief, thou king of ſwords, when Ryno lay on earth. What muſt

   think I hear thy voice, it is but the paſſing blaſt. Fingal has long ſince fallen aſleep, the
   ruler of the war !</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Then</hi> Gaul and Oſſian ſat with Swaran, on the ſoft green banks of Lubar. I

    Semo. Sad and ſlow he retired, from his hill, towards the
   lonely cave of Tura. He ſaw Fingal victorious, and mixed his joy with grief. The ſun is bright on
   his armour. Connal ſlowly ſtrode behind. They ſunk behind the hill, like two pillars of the fire
   of night: when winds purſue them over the mountain, and the flaming heath reſounds ! Beſide a
   ſtream of roaring foam his cave is in a rock. One tree bends above it. The ruſhing winds eccho
   againſt its ſides. Here reſts the chief of Erin, the ſon of generous Semo. His thoughts are on
   the battles he loſt. The tear is on his cheek. He mourned the departure of his fame, that fled
   like the miſt of Cona. O Bragela, thou art too far remote, to cheer the ſoul of the hero. But let
   him ſee thy bright form in his mind : that his thoughts may return to the lonely ſun-beam of his
   love !</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Who</hi> comes with the locks of age? It is the ſon of ſongs. “Hail, Carril of

  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Oſſian</hi>, king of ſwords,” replied the bard, “thou beſt can raiſe the ſong.

  <head>ARGUMENT to Book VI.</head>
  <p> Night comes on. Fingal gives a feaſt to his army, at which Swaran is preſent. The king
   commands Ullin his bard to give the <hi>ſong of peace</hi>; a cuſtom always obſerved at the end
   of a war. Ullin relates the actions of Trenmor, great grandfather to Fingal, in Scandinavia, and
   his marriage with Inibaca, the daughter of a king of Lochlin who was anceſtor to Swaran ; which
   conſideration, together with his being brother to Agandecca, with whom Fingal was in love in his
   youth, induced the king to releaſe him, and permit him to return, with the remains of his army,
   into Lochlin, upon his promiſe of never returning to Ireland, in a hoſtile manner. The night is
   ſpent in ſettling Swaran's departure, in ſongs of bards, and in a converſation in which the ſtory
   of Grumal is introduced by Fingal. Morning comes. Swaran departs; Fingal goes on a hunting party,
   and finding Cuthullin in the cave of Tura, comforts him, and ſets ſail, the next day, for
   Scotland; which concludes the poem. </p>

   plain of death ! Still on the duſky Lena aroſe in my ears the voice of Carril. He ſung of the

   Lochlin is ſilent. Sorrow reddens in the eyes of his pride. He often turned toward Lena. He
   remembered that he fell. Fingal leaned on the ſhield of his fathers. His grey locks ſlowly waved
   on the wind, and glittered to the beam of night, He ſaw the grief of Swaran, and ſpoke to the

   <p> Trenmor was great grandfather to Fingal. The ſtory is introduced to facilitate the diſmiſſion

   of the north : companion of the ſtorm ! The high rocks of the land of Lochlin; its groves of
   murmuring ſounds appeared to the hero through miſt : he bound his white-boſomed ſails. Trenmor
   purſued the boar, that roared through the woods of Gormal. Many had fled from its preſence: but
   it rolled in death on the ſpear of Trenmor. Three chiefs, who beheld the deed, told of the mighty
   ſtranger. They told that he ſtood, like a pillar of fire, in the bright arms of his valour. The
   king of Lochlin prepared the feaſt. He called the blooming Trenmor. Three days he feaſted at
   Gormal's windy towers; and received his choice in the combat. The land of Lochlin had no hero,
   that 
   <pb xml:id="P73110320" facs="../img/1773-985.pbm"/>
    yielded not to Trenmor. The ſhell of joy went round with
   ſongs, in praiſe of the king of Morven. He that came over the waves, the firſt of mighty men
   !”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Now</hi> when the fourth gray morn aroſe, the hero launched his ſhip. He walked
   along the ſilent ſhore, and called for the ruſhing wind: For loud and diſtant he heard the blaſt
   murmuring behind the groves. Covered over with arms of ſteel, a ſon of the woody Gormal appeared.
   Red was his cheek and fair his hair. His ſkin like the ſnow of Morven. Mild rolled his blue and
   ſmiling eye, when he ſpoke to the king of ſwords.</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Stay</hi>, Trenmor, ſtay thou firſt of men, thou haſt not conquered Lonval's
   ſon. My ſword has often met the brave. The wiſe ſhun the ſtrength of my bow.” “Thou fair-haired
   youth,” Trenmor replied, “I will not fight with Lonval's ſon. Thine arm is feeble, ſunbeam of
   youth. Retire to Gormal's dark-brown hinds.” “But I will retire,” replied the youth, “with the
   ſword of Trenmor ; and exult in the ſound of my fame. The virgins ſhall gather with ſmiles,
   around him who conquered mighty Trenmor. They ſhall ſigh with the ſighs of love, and admire the
   length of thy ſpear ; when 
   <pb xml:id="P73110321" facs="../img/1773-988.pbm"/>
    I ſhall carry it among thouſands ; when I lift the glittering

  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Thou</hi> ſhalt never carry my ſpear,” ſaid the angry king of Morven. “Thy
   mother ſhall find thee pale on the ſhore; and, looking over the dark-blue deep, ſee the ſails of
   him that ſlew her ſon!” “I will not lift the ſpear,” replied the youth,“my arm is not ſtrong with
   years. But, with the feathered dart, I have learned to pierce a diſtant foe. Throw down that
   heavy mail of ſteel. Trenmor is covered from death. I firſt, will lay my mail on earth. Throw now
   thy dart, thou king of Morven !'” He ſaw the heaving of her breaſt. It was the ſiſter of the
   king. She had ſeen him in the hall; and loved his face of youth. The ſpear dropt from the hand of
   Trenmor : he bent his red cheek to the ground. She was to him a beam of light that meets the ſons
   of the cave; when they reviſit the fields of the ſun, and bend their aching eyes !</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Chief</hi> of the windy Morven,” begun the maid of the arms of ſnow. “Let me
   reſt in thy bounding ſhip, far from the love of Corlo. For he, like the thunder of the deſart, is
   terrible to Inibaca. He loves me in the gloom of pride. He ſhakes ten thouſand ſpears !” “Reſt
   thou in peace,” ſaid the mighty Trenmor. “Reſt behind the ſhield of my fathers. I will not fly
   from the chief, though he ſhakes ten

    thouſand ſpears!” Three days he waited on the ſhore. He ſent
   his horn abroad. He called Corlo to battle, from all his ecchoing hills. But Corlo came not to
   battle, The king of Lochlin deſcends from his hall. He feaſted on the roaring ſhore. He gave the
   maid to Trenmor !</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">King</hi> of Lochlin,” ſaid Fingal, “thy blood flows in the veins of thy foe.
   Our fathers met in battle, becauſe they loved the ſtrife of ſpears. But often did they feaſt in
   the hall: and ſend round the joy of the ſhell. Let thy face brighten with gladneſs, and thine ear
   delight in the harp. Dreadful as the ſtorm of thine ocean, thou haſt poured thy valour forth; thy
   voice has been like the voice of thouſands when they engage in war. Raiſe, to-morrow, raiſe thy
   white ſails to the wind, thou brother of Agandecca ! Bright as the beam of noon, ſhe comes on my
   mournful ſoul. I have ſeen thy tears for the fair one. I ſpared thee in the halls of Starno ;
   when my ſword was red with ſlaughter ; when my eye was full of tears for the maid. Or doſt thou
   chuſe the fight ? The combat which thy fathers gave to Trenmor is thine ! that thou mayeſt depart
   renowned, like the ſun ſetting in the weſt!”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">King</hi> of the race of Morven,” ſaid the chief of reſounding Lochlin! “never

   : few were

    thy years beyond my own. When ſhall I, I ſaid to my ſoul,
   lift the ſpear like the noble Fingal? We have fought heretofore, O warrior, on the ſide of the
   ſhaggy Malmor ; after my waves had carried me to thy halls, and the feaſt of a thouſand ſhells
   was ſpread. Let the bards ſend his name who overcame to future years, for noble was the ſtrife of
   Malmor! But many of the ſhips of Lochlin have loſt their youths on Lena. Take theſe, thou king of
   Morven, and be the friend of Swaran ! When thy ſons ſhall come to Gormal, the feaſt of ſhells
   ſhall be ſpread, and the combat offered on the vale.”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Nor</hi> ſhip,” replied the king, “ſhall Fingal take, nor land of many hills.
   The deſart is enough to me, with all its deer and woods. Riſe on thy waves again, thou noble
   friend of Agandecca. Spread thy white ſails to the beam of the morning; return to the ecchoing
   hills of Gormal.” “Bleſt be thy ſoul, thou king of ſhells, ſaid Swaran of the dark-brown ſhield.
   “In peace thou art the gale of ſpring. In war the mountain-ſtorm. Take now my hand in friendſhip,
   king of ecchoing Selma! Let thy bards mourn thoſe who fell. Let Erin give the ſons of Lochlin to
   earth. Raiſe high the moſſy ſtones of their fame : that the children of the north hereafter may
   behold the place, where their fathers fought. The hunter may ſay, when he leans on a moſſy

   Thus hereafter ſhall he ſay, and our fame ſhall laſt for ever!”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Swaran</hi>, ſaid the king of hills,“to-day our fame is greateſt. We ſhall paſs
   away like a dream. No ſound will remain in our fields of war. Our tombs will be loſt in the

   avails it, when our ſtrength hath ceaſed? O Oſſian, Carril, and Ullin, you know of heroes that
   are no more. Give us the ſong of other years. Let the night paſs away on the ſound, and morning
   return with joy.”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> gave the ſong to the kings. An hundred harps mixed their ſound with our

   and leave her calm and broad, in the midſt of the ſky !</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Where</hi>, Carril,” ſaid the great Fingal, « Carril of other times! Where is
   the ſon of Semo ? the king of the iſle of miſt? has he retired, like the meteor of death, to the
   dreary cave of Tura ?” “Cuthullin,” ſaid Carril of other times, “lies in the dreary cave of Tura.
   His hand is on the ſword of his ſtrength. His thoughts on the battles he loſt. Mournful is the
   king of ſpears; till now unconquered in war. He ſends his ſword to reſt on the ſide of Fingal :

    For, like the ſtorm of the deſart, thou haſt ſcattered all
   his foes. Take, O Fingal, the ſword of the hero. His fame is departed like miſt, when it flies,
   before the ruſtling wind, along the brightening vale.</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">No</hi>:” replied the king, “Fingal ſhall never take his ſword. His arm is
   mighty in war : his fame ſhall never fail. Many have been overcome in battle; whoſe renown aroſe
   from their fall. O Swaran, king of reſounding woods, give all thy grief away, The vanquiſhed, if
   brave, are renowned. They are like the ſun in a cloud, when he hides his face in the ſouth, but
   looks again on the hills of graſs !</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Grumal</hi> was a Chief of Cona, He ſought the battle on every coaſt. His ſoul
   rejoiced in blood. His ear in the din of arms. He poured his warriors on Craca; Craca's king met
   him from his grove: for then, within the circle of Brumo<note xmlns:t="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="bottom">
   <p> This paſſage alludes to the religion of the king of Craca. </p>
   </note>, he ſpoke to the ſtone of power. Fierce was the battle of the heroes, for the maid of the

   vowed to have the white-boſomed maid, or die on ecchoing Craca. Three days they ſtrove together,
   and Grumal on the fourth 
   <pb xml:id="P73110326" facs="../img/1773-1003.pbm"/>
    was bound. Far from his friends they placed him, in the horrid
   circle of Brumo ; where often, they ſaid, the ghoſts of the dead howled round the ſtone of their
   fear. But he afterwards ſhone, like a pillar of the light of heaven. They fell by his mighty
   hand. Grumal had all his fame !”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Raise</hi>, ye bards of other times,” continued the great Fingal, “raiſe high
   the praiſe of heroes : that my ſoul may ſettle on their fame; that the mind of Swaran may ceaſe
   to be ſad.” They lay in the heath of Mora. The dark winds ruſtled over the chiefs. A hundred
   voices, at once, aroſe : a hundred harps were ſtrung. They ſung of other times ; the mighty
   chiefs of former years! When now ſhall I hear the bard? When rejoice at the fame of my fathers?
   The harp is not ſtrung on Morven. The voice of muſic aſcends not on Cona. Dead, with the mighty,
   is the bard. Fame is in the deſart no more.</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Morning</hi> trembles with the beam of the eaſt; it glimmers on Comla's ſide.
   Over Lena is heard the horn of Swaran. The ſons of the ocean gather around. Silent and ſad they
   riſe on the wave. The blaſt of Erin is behind their ſails. White, as the miſt of Morven, they
   float along the ſea. “Call,” ſaid Fingal, “call my

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> ſhrill ſound ſpreads along the wood. The ſons of heathy Cromla ariſe. A

   might be great ! One deer fell at the tomb of Ryno. The grief of Fingal returned. He ſaw how
   peaceful lay the ſtone of him, who was the firſt at the chace ! “No more ſhalt thou riſe, O my

   <p> Lathmon, a Britiſh prince, taking advantage of Fingal's abſence on an expedition in Ireland,
    made a deſcent on Morven, and advanced within ſight of Selma, the royal reſidence. Fingal
    arrived in the mean time, and Lathmon retreated to a hill, where his army was ſurprized by
    night, and himſelf taken priſoner by Oſſian and Gaul the ſon of Morni. The poem opens, with the

  <p> <hi rend="smallcaps">Selma</hi>, thy halls are ſilent. There is no ſound in the woods of Morven. The
   wave tumbles alone on the coaſt. The ſilent beam of the ſun is on the field. The daughters of
   Morven come forth, like the bow of the ſhower; they look towards green Erin for the white ſails
   of the king. He had promiſed to return, but the winds of the north aroſe !</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Who</hi> pours from the eaſtern hill, like a ſtream of darkneſs? It is the hoſt
   of Lathmon. He has heard of the abſence of Fingal. He truſts in the wind of the north. His ſoul

   with thy forward ſpear ? Will the daughters of Morven fight? But ſtop, O mighty ſtream, in thy
   courſe! Does not Lathmon behold theſe ſails? Why doſt thou vaniſh, Lathmon, like the miſt of the

    <hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> king of Morven had ſtarted from ſleep, as we rolled
   on the dark-blue wave. He ſtretched his hand to his ſpear, his heroes roſe around. We knew that
   he had ſeen his fathers, for they often deſcended to his dreams, when the ſword of the foe roſe
   over the land; and the battle darkened before us. “Whither haſt thou fled, O wind?” ſaid the king
   of Morven. “Doſt thou ruſtle in the chambers of the ſouth, purſueſt thou the ſhower in other
   lands ? Why doſt thou not come to my ſails? to the blue face of my ſeas? The foe is in the land

   Stretch every ſpear over the wave; let every ſword be unſheathed. Lathmon<note xmlns:t="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="bottom">
   <p>It is ſaid by tradition, that it was the intelligence of Lathmon's invaſion, that occaſioned

   <p> Morni was chief of a numerous tribe, in the days of Fingal, and his father Comhal. The laſt

   <p> Stru'-moné, <hi>ſtream of the hill</hi>. Here the proper name of a rivulet in the

   </note> : his locks of age are grey : he leans forward on his ſtaff; young Gaul is near the hero,
   hearing the battles of his father. Often did he riſe, in the fire of his ſoul, at the mighty
   deeds of Morni. The aged heard the ſound of Oſſian's ſhield : he knew the ſign of war. He ſtarted
   at once from his place. His grey hair parted on his back. He remembered the deeds of other
   years.</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">My</hi> ſon,” he ſaid to fair-haired Gaul, “I hear the ſound of war. The king of
   Morven is returned, his ſignals are ſpread on the wind. Go to the halls of Strumon ; bring his
   arms to Morni. Bring the ſhield of my father's latter years, for my arm begins to fail. Take thou
   thy armour, O Gaul; and ruſh to the firſt of

    thy battles. Let thine arm reach to the renown of thy fathers. Be thy
   courſe in the field, like the eagle's wing. Why ſhouldſt thou fear death, my ſon ? the valiant
   fall with fame; their ſhields turn the dark ſtream of danger away ; renown dwells on their aged
   hairs. Doſt thou not ſee, O Gaul, how the ſteps of my age are honoured ? Morni moves forth, and
   the young meet him, with awe, and turn their eyes, with ſilent joy, on his courſe. But I never
   fled from danger, my ſon! my ſword lightened through the darkneſs of war. The ſtranger melted
   before me; the mighty were blaſted in my preſence.”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gaul</hi> brought the arms to Morni: the aged warrior is covered with ſteel. He
   took the ſpear in his hand, which was ſtained with the blood of the valiant. He came towards
   Fingal, his ſon attended his ſteps. The ſon of Comhal aroſe before him with joy, when he came in
   his locks of age.</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chief</hi> of roaring Strumon! ſaid the riſing ſoul of Fingal ; do I behold thee
   in arms, after thy ſtrength has failed ? Often has Morni ſhone in fight, like the beam of the
   aſcending ſun ; when he diſperſes the ſtorms of the hill, and brings peace to the glittering
   fields. But why didſt thou not reſt in thine age? Thy renown 
   <pb xml:id="P73110337" facs="../img/1773-1036.pbm"/>
    is in the ſong. The people behold thee, and bleſs the departure of mighty
   Morni. Why didſt thou not reſt in thine age? The foe will vaniſh before Fingal !</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Son</hi> of Comhal, replied the chief, the ſtrength of Morni's arm has failed. I
   attempt to draw the ſword of my youth, but it remains in its place. I throw the ſpear, but it
   falls ſhort of the mark. I feel the weight of my ſhield. We decay like the graſs of the hill :
   our ſtrength returns no more. I have a ſon, O Fingal, his ſoul has delighted in Morni's deeds;
   but his ſword has not been lifted againſt a foe, neither has his fame begun. I come with him to
   war; to direct his arm in fight. His renown will be a light to my ſoul, in the dark hour of my
   departure. O that the name of Morni were forgot among the people! that the heroes would only ſay,
   “Behold the father of Gaul !”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">King</hi> of Strumon, Fingal replied, Gaul ſhall lift the ſword in fight. But he
   ſhall lift it before Fingal; my arm ſhall defend his youth. But reſt thou in the halls of Selma ;
   and hear of our renown. Bid the harp to be ſtrung ; and the voice of the bard to ariſe, that
   thoſe who fall may rejoice in their fame; and the ſoul of Morni brighten with joy. Oſſian ! thou
   haſt fought in

   <p> Oſſian ſpeaks. The contraſt between the old and young heroes is ſtrongly marked. The

   the empty air.</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Night</hi> came down on Morven. Fingal ſat at the beam of the oak. Morni ſat by
   his ſide with all his grey waving locks. Their words were of other times, of the mighty deeds of

   <p> Ullin had choſen ill the ſubject of his ſong. The <hi>darkneſs which gathered on Morni's

    from his fear that the ſong would awaken Fingal to a remembrance of the feuds which had
    ſubſiſted of old between the families. Fingal's ſpeech on this occaſion abounds with generoſity
    and good ſenſe. </p>

    on Morni's brow. He rolled his red eye on Ullin : at once ceaſed the ſong of
   the bard. Fingal obſerved the aged hero, and he mildly ſpoke. “Chief of Strumon, why that
   darkneſs ? Let the days of other years be forgot. Our fathers contended in war ; but we meet
   together, at the feaſt. Our ſwords are turned on the foe of our land : he melts before us in the
   field. Let the days of our fathers be forgot, hero of moſſy Strumon !”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">King</hi> of Morven, replied the chief, “I remember thy father with joy. He was
   terrible in battle; the rage of the chief was deadly. My eyes were full of tears, when the king
   of heroes fell. The valiant fall, O Fingal! the feeble remain on the hills! How many heroes have
   paſſed away, in the days of Morni! Yet I did not ſhun the battle; neither did I fly from the
   ſtrife of the valiant. Now let the friends of Fingal reſt ; for the night is around ; that they
   may riſe, with ſtrength, to battle againſt car-borne Lathmon. I hear the ſound of his hoſt, like
   thunder moving on the hills. Oſſian ! and fair-haired Gaul! ye are young and ſwift in the race.
   Obſerve the foes of Fingal from that woody hill. But approach them not, your fathers are not near
   to ſhield you. Let not 
   <pb xml:id="P73110340" facs="../img/1773-1045.pbm"/>
    your fame fall at once. The valour of youth may fail !”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> heard the words of the chief with joy. We moved in the clang of our arms.
   Our ſteps are on the woody hill. Heaven burns with all its ſtars. The meteors of death fly over
   the field. The diſtant noiſe of the foe reached our ears. It was then Gaul ſpoke, in his valour :
   his hand half-unſheathed the ſword.</p>
  <p>“Son of Fingal,” he ſaid, “why burns the ſoul of Gaul? My heart beats high. My ſteps are
   diſordered ; my hand trembles on my ſword. When I look towards the foe, my ſoul lightens before
   me. I ſee their ſleeping hoſt. Tremble thus the ſouls of the valiant in battles of the ſpear? How
   would the ſoul of Morni riſe if we ſhould ruſh on the foe! Our renown would grow in ſong : Our
   ſteps would be ſtately in the eyes of the brave.”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Son</hi> of Morni,” I replied, “my ſoul delights in war. I delight to ſhine in
   battle alone, to give my name to the bards. But what if the foe ſhould prevail; can I behold the
   eyes of the king ? They are terrible in his diſpleaſure, and like the flames of death. But I will
   not behold them in his wrath ! Oſſian ſhall prevail or fall. But ſhall the fame of the vanquiſhed
   riſe ? 
   <pb xml:id="P73110341" facs="../img/1773-1048.pbm"/>
    They paſs like a ſhade away. But the fame of Oſſian ſhall riſe! His deeds
   ſhall be like his fathers. Let us ruſh in our arms; ſon of Morni, let us ruſh to fight. Gaul! if
   thou ſhouldſt return, go to Selma's lofty Hall. Tell to Evirallin that I fell with fame; carry
   this ſword to Pranno's daughter. Let her give it to Oſcar, when the years of his youth ſhall
   ariſe,”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Son</hi> of Fingal,” Gaul replied with a ſigh “ſhall I return after Oſſian is
   low ? What would my father ſay, what Fingal the king of men ? The feeble would turn their eyes
   and ſay, “Behold Gaul who left his friend in his blood !” Ye ſhall not behold me, ye feeble, but
   in the midſt of my renown. Oſſian! I have heard from my father the mighty deeds of heroes ; their
   mighty deeds when alone; for the ſoul increaſes in danger.”</p>
  <p>“Son of Morni,” I replied and ſtrode before him on the heath, “our fathers ſhall praiſe our
   valour, when they mourn our fall. A beam of gladneſs ſhall riſe on their ſouls, when their eyes
   are full of tears. They will ſay, “Our ſons have not fallen unknown : they ſpread death around
   them.” But why ſhould we think of the narrow houſe ? The ſword defends the brave.
   
   <pb xml:id="P73110342" facs="../img/1773-1051.pbm"/>
    But death purſues the flight of the feeble ; their renown is never
   heard.”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> ruſhed forward through night ; we came to the roar of a ſtream, which
   bent its blue courſe round the foe, through trees that ecchoed to its ſound. We came to the bank
   of the ſtream, and ſaw the ſleeping hoſt. Their fires were decayed on the plain; the lonely ſteps
   of their ſcouts were diſtant far. I ſtretched my ſpear before me to ſupport my ſteps over the
   ſtream. But Gaul took my hand, and ſpoke the words of the brave. “Shall the ſon of Fingal ruſh on
   the ſleeping foe ? Shall he come like a blaſt by night, when it overturns the young trees in
   ſecret ? Fingal did not thus receive his fame, nor dwells renown on the grey hairs of Morni, for
   actions like theſe. Strike, Oſſian, ſtrike the ſhield, and let their thouſands riſe. Let them
   meet Gaul in his firſt battle, that he may try the ſtrength of his arm.” </p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My</hi> ſoul rejoiced over the warrior: my burſting tears came down. “And the foe
   ſhall meet thee, Gaul!” I ſaid : “the fame of Morni's ſon ſhall ariſe. But ruſh not too far, my
   hero : let the gleam of thy ſteel be near to Oſſian. Let our hands join in ſlaughter. Gaul ! doſt
   thou not behold that rock? Its grey ſide dimly 
   <pb xml:id="P73110343" facs="../img/1773-1054.pbm"/>
    gleams to the ſtars. Should the foe prevail, let our back be towards the
   rock. Then ſhall they fear to approach our ſpears; for death is in our hands !”</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">I struck</hi> thrice my ecchoing ſhield. The ſtarting foe aroſe. We ruſhed on in
   the ſound of our arms. Their crouded ſteps fly over the heath. They thought that the mighty
   Fingal was come. The ſtrength of their arms withered away. The ſound of their flight was like
   that of flame, when it ruſhes thro' the blaſted groves. It was then the ſpear of Gaul flew in its
   ſtrength; it was then his ſword aroſe. Cremor fell; and mighty Leth. Dunthormo ſtruggled in his
   blood. The ſteel ruſhed through Crotho's ſide, as bent, he roſe on his ſpear ; the black ſtream
   poured from the wound, and hiſſed on the half-extinguiſhed oak. Cathmin ſaw the ſteps of the hero
   behind him, he aſcended a blaſted tree but the ſpear pierced him from behind. Shrieking, panting,
   he fell. Moſs and withered branches purſue his fall, and ſtrew the blue arms of Gaul.</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Such</hi> were thy deeds, ſon of Morni, in the firſt of thy battles. Nor ſlept

   The foe gathered on a hill; and the rage of Lathmon roſe. He bent the red eye of his wrath : he
   is ſilent in his riſing grief. He often ſtruck his boſſy ſhield ; and his ſteps are unequal on

   point fell glittering on earth. The ſon of Nuäth burnt in his wrath. He lifted high his ſounding
   ſhield. His dark eyes rolled above it, as bending forward, it ſhone like a gate of braſs! But
   Oſſian's ſpear pierced the brightneſs of its boſſes, and ſunk in a tree that roſe behind. The

   can equal the renown of the heroes, whoſe deeds are ſo great in youth ? O that ye were in the

   <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
   <p> It may not be improper here, to give the ſtory which is the foundation of this poem, as it is
    handed down by tradition. Uſnoth lord of Etha, which is probably that part of Argyleſhire which
    is near Loch Eta, an arm of the ſea in Lorn, had three ſons, Nathos, Althos, and Ardan by
    Sliſſáma, the daughter of Semo and ſiſter to the celebrated Cuthullin. The three brothers, when
    very young, were ſent over to Ireland, by their father, to learn the uſe of arms, under their
    uncle, Cuthullin, who made a great figure in that kingdom. They were juſt landed in Ulſter when
    the news of Cuthullin's death arrived. Nathos, though very young, took the command of
    Cuthullin's army, made head againſt Cairbar the uſurper, and defeated him in ſeveral battles.
    Cairbar at laſt having found means to murder Cormac the lawful king, the army of Nathos ſhifted
    ſides, and he himſelf was obliged to return into Ulſter, in order to paſs over into
    Scotland.</p>
   <p>Dar-thula, the daughter of Colia, with whom Cairbar was in love, reſided, at that time, in
    Selama, a caſtle in Ulſter : ſhe ſaw, fell in love, and fled with Nathos; but a ſtorm riſing at
    ſea, they were unfortunately driven back on that part of the coaſt of Ulſter, where Cairbar was
    encamped with his army. The three brothers, after having defended themſelves, for ſome time,
    with great bravery, were overpowered and ſlain, and the unfortunate Dar-thula killed herſelf
    upon the body of her beloved Nathos.</p>
   <p>The poem opens, on the night preceding the death of the ſons of Uſnoth, and brings in, by way
    of epiſode, what paſſed before. It relates the death of Dar-thula differently from the common
    tradition ; this account is the moſt probable, as ſuicide ſeems to have been unknown in thoſe
    early times: for no traces of it are found in the old poetry. </p>

   Thou comeſt forth in lovelineſs. The ſtars attend thy blue courſe in the eaſt. The clouds rejoice

   of the ſilent night? The ſtars are aſhamed in thy preſence. They turn away, their ſparkling eyes.
   Whither doſt thou retire from thy courſe, when the darkneſs of thy countenance grows? Haſt thou
   thy hall, like Oſſian ? Dwelleſt thou in the ſhadow of grief? Have thy ſiſters fallen from
   heaven? Are they who rejoiced with thee, at night, no more? Yes! they have fallen, fair light!
   and thou doſt often retire to mourn. But thou thyſelf ſhalt fail, one night; and leave thy blue
   path in heaven. The ſtars will then lift their heads: they, who were aſhamed in thy preſence,
   will rejoice. Thou art now clothed

   <p> Cairbar, who murdered Cormac king of Ireland, and uſurped the throne. He was afterwards

   the gliding ſtream of Lora! But when the rage of battle roſe, thou waſt a ſea in a ſtorm. The

   bluſtering ſound is high. Ceaſe a little while, O north wind. Let me hear the voice of the

  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Are</hi> theſe the rocks of Nathos?” ſhe ſaid, “This the roar of his

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">He</hi> returned, but his face was dark. He had ſeen his departed friend ! It was
   the wall of Tura. The ghoſt of Cuthullin ſtalked there alone : The ſighing of his breaſt was
   frequent. The decayed flame of his eyes was terrible ! His ſpear was a column of miſt. The ſtars
   looked dim through his form. His voice was like hollow wind in a cave : his eye a light ſeen
   afar. He told the tale of grief. The ſoul of Nathos was ſad, like the ſun in the day of miſt,
   when his face is watry and dim.</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Why</hi> art thou ſad, O Nathos ?” ſaid the lovely daughter of Colla. “Thou art

   Truthil paſt before my ſoul : the brother of my love : He that was abſent in battle, againſt the

   ſorrow dwells in his ſoul. His ſword is on the ſide of the hero : the helmet of his fathers on

   <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
   <p> Cuthullin, after the arms of Fingal had expelled Swaran from Ireland, continued to manage the
    affairs of that kingdom as the guardian of Cormac, the young king. In the third year of
    Cuthullin's adminiſtration, Torlath, the ſon of Cantela, rebelled in Connaught; and advanced to
    Temora to dethrone Cormac. Cuthullin marched againſt him, came up with him at the lake of Lego,
    and totally defeated his forces. Torlath fell in battle by Cuthullin's hand ; but as he
    too-eagerly preſſed on the enemy, he was mortally wounded. The affairs of Cormac, though, for
    ſometime, ſupported by Nathos, as mentioned in the preceding poem, fell into confuſion at the
    death of Cuthullin. Cormac himſelf was ſlain by the rebel Cairbar; and the re-eſtabliſhment of
    the royal family of Ireland by Fingal, furniſhes the ſubject of the epic poem of Temora. </p>

   <p> Fingal, on his return from Ireland, after he had expelled Swaran from that kingdom, made a
    feaſt to all his heroes : he forgot to invite Ma-ronnan and Aldo, two chiefs, who had not been
    along with him in his expedition. They reſented his neglect; and went over to Erragon king of
    Sora, a country of Scandinavia, the declared enemy of Fingal. The valour of Aldo ſoon gained him
    a great reputation in Sora: and Lorma the beautiful wife of Erragon fell in love with him. He
    found means to eſcape with her, and to come to Fingal, who reſided then in Selma on the weſtern
    coaſt. Erragon invaded Scotland, and was ſlain in battle by Gaul the ſon of Morni, after he had
    rejected terms of peace offered him by Fingal. In this war Aldo fell, in a ſingle combat, by the
    hands of his rival Erragon; and the unfortunate Lorma afterwards died of grief. </p>

   rocks, for the fall of the terrible Swaran. Two heroes were forgot at our feaſt, The rage of
   their boſoms burned. They rolled their red eyes in ſecret. The ſigh burſts from their breaſts.

   Thou didſt promiſe to return. Has the deer been diſtant far? do the dark winds ſigh, round thee,
   on the heath? I am in the land of ſtrangers, where is my friend, but Aldo? Come from thy ſounding
   hills, O my beſt beloved !”

  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Her</hi> eyes are turned toward the gate. She liſtens to the ruſtling blaſt. She
   thinks it is Aldo's tread. Joy riſes in her face! But ſorrow returns again, like a thin cloud on
   the moon. “Wilt thou not return, my love? Let me behold the face of the hill. The moon is in the
   eaſt. Calm and bright is the breaſt of the lake ! When ſhall I behold his dogs, returning from
   the chace ? When ſhall I hear his voice, loud and diſtant on the wind ? Come from thy ſounding
   hills, hunter of woody Cona !” His thin ghoſt appeared, on a rock, like a watry beam of feeble
   light : When the moon ruſhes ſudden from between two clouds, and the midnight ſhower is on the
   field ! She followed the empty form over the heath. She knew that her hero fell. I heard her
   approaching cries on the wind, like the mournful voice of the breeze, when it ſighs on the graſs
   of the cave !</p>
  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">She</hi> came. She found her hero ! Her voice was heard no more. Silent ſhe
   rolled her eyes. She was pale, and wildly ſad! Few were her days on Cona. She ſunk into the tomb.
   Fingal commanded his bards; they ſung over the death of Lorma. The daughters of Morven mourned
   her, for one day in the year, when the dark winds of autumn returned !</p>
