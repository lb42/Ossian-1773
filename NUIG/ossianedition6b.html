   <h3 class="normal">ARGUMENT to <span class="sc">Book</span> I.</h3>
   <p class="noindent"> Cairbar, the ſon of Borbar-duthul, lord of Atha in Connaught the moſt potent chief of the
   race of the Firbolg, having murdered, at Temora the royal palace, Cormac the ſon of Artho, the
   young king of Ireland, uſurped the throne. Cormac was lineally deſcended from Conar the ſon of
   Trenmor, the great grandfather of Fingal, king of thoſe Caledonians who inhabited the weſtern
   coaſt of Scotland. Fingal reſented the behaviour of Cairbar, and reſolved to paſs over into
   Ireland, with an army, to re-eſtabliſh the royal family on the Iriſh throne. Early intelligence
   of his deſigns coming to Cairbar, he aſſembled ſome of his tribes in Ulſter, and at the ſame time
   ordered his brother Cathmor to follow him ſpeedily with an army, from Temora. Such was the
   ſituation of affairs when the Caledonian invaders appeared on the coaſt of Ulſter.</p>
   <p class="noindent">The poem opens in the morning. Cairbar is repreſented as retired from the reſt of the army,
   when one of his ſcouts brought him news of the landing of Fingal. He aſſembles a council of his
   chiefs. Foldath the chief of Morna haughtily deſpiſes the enemy ; and is reprimanded warmly by
   Malthos. Cairbar, after hearing their debate, orders a feaſt to be prepared, to which, by his
   bard Olla, he invites Oſcar the ſon of Oſſian ; reſolving to pick a quarrel with that hero, and
   ſo have ſome pretext for killing him. Oſcar came to the feaſt; the quarrel happened ; the
   followers of both fought, and Cairbar and Oſcar fell by mutual wounds. The noiſe of the battle
   reached Fingal's army. The king came on, to the relief of Oſcar, and the Iriſh fell back to the
   army of Cathmor, who was advanced to the banks of the river Lubar, on the heath of Moilena.
   Fingal, after mourning over his grandſon, ordered Ullin the chief of his bards to carry his body
   to Morven, to be there interred. Night coming on, Althan, the ſon of Conachar, relates to the
   king the particulars of the murder of Cormac. Fillan, the ſon of Fingal, is ſent to obſerve the
   motions of Cathmar by night, which concludes the action of the firſt day. The ſcene of this book
   is a plain, near the hill of Mora, which roſe on the borders of the heath of Moilena, in Ulſter. </p>

  <p class="noindent"> <span class="sc">The</span> blue waves of Erin roll in light. The mountains are covered with day.
   Trees ſhake their duſky heads, in the breeze. Grey torrents pour their noiſy ſtreams. Two green
   hills, with aged oaks, ſurround a narrow plain. The blue courſe of a ſtream is there. On its
   banks ſtood Cairbar<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753336193856"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a> of Atha. His ſpear ſupports the king : the red eye of his fear is ſad. Cormac riſes in

    The grey form of the youth appears in darkneſs. Blood pours from
   his airy ſide. Cairbar thrice threw his ſpear on earth. Thrice he ſtroaked his beard. His ſteps
   are ſhort. He often ſtops. He toſſes his ſinewy arms. He is like a cloud in the deſart, varying
   its form to every blaſt. The valleys are ſad around, and fear, by turns, the ſhower ! The king,
   at length, reſumed his ſoul. He took his pointed ſpear, He turned his eye to Moi-lena, The ſcouts
   of blue ocean came. They came with ſteps of fear, and often looked behind. Cairbar knew that the
   mighty were near ! He called his gloomy chiefs.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſounding ſteps of his warriors came. They drew, at once, their ſwords.

 <h3 class="normal">TEMORA: AN EPIC POEM. BOOK II.</h3>
 
  <h3 class="normal">ARGUMENT to Book II.</h3>
  <p class="noindent"> This book opens, we may ſuppoſe, about midnight, with a ſoliloquy of Oſſian, who had retired,
   from the reſt of the army, to mourn for his ſon Oſcar. Upon hearing the noiſe of Cathmor's army
   approaching, he went to find out his brother Fillan, who kept the watch, on the hill of Mora, in
   the front of Fingal's army. In the converſation of the brothers, the epiſode of Conar, the ſon of
   Trenmor, who was the firſt king of Ireland, is introduced, which lays open the origin of the
   conteſts between the Cael and Firbolg, the two nations who firſt poſſeſſed themſelves of that
   iſland. Oſſian kindles a fire on Mora ; upon which Cathmor deſiſted from the deſign he had formed
   of ſurpriſing the army of the Caledonians. He calls a council of his chiefs; reprimands Foldath
   for adviſing a night-attack, as the Iriſh army were ſo much ſuperior in number to the enemy. The
   bard Fonar introduces the ſtory of Crothar, the anceſtor of the king, which throws further light
   on the hiſtory of Ireland, and the original pretenſions of the family of Atha, to the throne of
   that kingdom. The Iriſh chiefs lie down to reſt, and Cathmor himſelf undertakes the watch. In his
   circuit, round the army, he is met by Oſſian. The interview of the two heroes is deſcribed.
   Cathmor obtains a promiſe from Oſſian, to order a funeral elegy to be ſung over the grave of
   Cairbar; it being the opinion of the times, that the ſouls of the dead could not be happy, till
   their elegies were ſung by a bard. Morning comes. Cathmor and Oſſian part; and the latter,
   caſually meeting with Carril the ſon of Kinſena, ſends that bard, with a funeral ſong, to the
   tomb of Cairbar. </p>

  <h3 class="normal">ARGUMENT to Book III.</h3>
  <p class="noindent"> <span class="sc">Morning</span> coming on, Fingal, after a ſpeech to his people, devolves the
   command on Gaul, the ſon of Morni ; it being the cuſtom of the times, that the king ſhould not
   engage, till the neceſſity of affairs required his ſuperior valour and conduct. The king and
   Oſſian retire to the rock of Cormul, which overlooked the field of battle. The bards ſing the
   war-ſong. The general conflict is deſcribed. Gaul, the ſon of Morni, diſtinguiſhes himſelf ;
   kills Tur-lathon, chief of Moruth, and other chiefs of leſſer name. On the other hand, Foldath,
   who commanded the Iriſh army (for Cathmor, after the example of Fingal, kept himſelf from battle)
   fights gallantly ; kills Connal, chief of Dun-lora, and advances to engage Gaul himſelf. Gaul, in
   the mean time, being wounded in the hand, by a random arrow, is covered by Fillan, the ſon of
   Fingal, who performs prodigies of valour. Night comes on. The horn of Fingal recalls his army.
   The bards meet them, with a congratulatory ſong, in which the praiſes of Gaul and Fillan are
   particularly celebrated. The chiefs ſit down at a feaſt; Fingal miſſes Connal. The epiſode of
   Connal and Duthcaron is introduced ; which throws further light on the ancient hiſtory of
   Ireland. Carril is diſpatched to raiſe the tomb of Connal. The action of this book takes up the
   ſecond day, from the opening of the poem. </p>

   expedition into Ireland, and his marriage with Ros-crána, the daughter of Cormac, king of that
   iſland. The Iriſh chiefs convene in the preſence of Cathmor. The ſituation of the king deſcribed.
   The ſtory of Sul-mala, the daughter of Conmor, king of Inis-huna, who, in the diſguiſe of a young
   warrior, had followed Cathmor to the war. The ſullen behaviour of Foldath, who had commanded in
   the battle of the preceding day, renews the difference between him and Malthos; but Cathmor,
   interpoſing, ends it. The chiefs feaſt, and hear the ſong of Fonar the bard. Cathmor returns to
   reſt, at a diſtance from the army. The ghoſt of his brother Cairbar appears to him in a dream;
   and obſcurely foretels the iſſue of the war. The ſoliloquy of the king. He diſcovers Sul-malla.

  <h3 class="normal">ARGUMENT to Book V.</h3>
  <p class="noindent"> The poet, after a ſhort addreſs to the harp of Cona, deſcribes the arrangement of both armies
   on either ſide of the river Lubar. Fingal gives the command to Fillan ; but, at the ſame time,
   orders Gaul, the ſon of Morni, who had been wounded in the hand in the preceding battle, to
   aſſiſt him with his counſel. The army of the Fir-bolg is commanded by Foldath. The general onſet
   is deſcribed. The great actions of Fillan. He kills Rothmar and Culmin. But when Fillan conquers,
   in one wing, Foldath preſſes hard on the other. He wounds Dermid, the ſon of Duthno, and puts the
   whole wing to flight. Dermid deliberates with himſelf, and, at laſt, reſolves to put a ſtop to
   the progreſs of Foldath, by engaging him in ſingle combat. When the two chiefs were approaching
   towards one another, Fillan came ſuddenly to the relief of Dermid ; engaged Foldath, and killed
   him. The behaviour of Malthos towards the fallen Foldath. Fillan puts the whole army of the
   Fir-bolg to flight. The book cloſes with an addreſs to Clatho, the mother of that hero. </p>

  <h3 class="normal">ARGUMENT to Book VI.</h3>
  <p class="noindent"> <span class="sc">This</span> book opens with a ſpeech of Fingal, who ſees Cathmor deſcending to the
   aſſiſtance of his flying army. The king diſpatches Oſſian to the relief of Fillan. He himſelf
   retires behind the rock of Cormul, to avoid the ſight of the engagement between his ſon and
   Cathmor. Oſſian advances. The deſcent of Cathmor deſcribed. He rallies the army, renews the
   battle, and, before Oſſian could arrive, engages Fillan himſelf. Upon the approach of Oſſian, the
   combat between the two heroes ceaſes. Oſſian and Cathmor prepare to fight, but night coming on
   prevents them. Oſſian returns to the place where Cathmor and Fillan fought. He finds Fillan
   mortally wounded, and leaning againſt a rock. Their diſcourſe. Fillan dies: his body is laid, by
   Oſſian, in a neighbouring cave. The Caledonian army return to Fingal. He queſtions them about his
   ſon, and, underſtanding that he was killed, retires, in ſilence, to the rock of Cormul. Upon the
   retreat of the army of Fingal, the Fir-bolg advance. Cathmor finds Bran, one of the dogs of
   Fingal, lying on the ſhield of Fillan, before the entrance of the cave, where the body of that
   hero lay. His reflections thereupon. He returns, in a melancholy mood, to his army. Malthos
   endeavours to comfort him, by the example of his father Borbar-duthal. Cathmor retires to reſt.
   The ſong of Sul-malla concludes the book, which ends about the middle of the third night, from
   the opening of the poem. </p>

  <p class="noindent"> The fourth morning, from the opening of the poem, comes on. Fingal, ſtill continuing in the
   place, to which he had retired on the preceding night, is ſeen, at intervals, thro' the miſt,
   which covered the rock of Cormul. The deſcent of the king is deſcribed. He orders Gaul, Dermid,
   and Carril the bard, to go to the valley of Cluna, and conduct, from thence, to the Caledonian
   army, Ferad-artho, the ſon of Cairbre, the only perſon remaining of the family of Conar, the
   firſt king of Ireland. The king takes the command of the army, and prepares for battle. Marching
   towards the enemy, he comes to the cave of Lubar, where the body of Fillan lay. Upon ſeeing his
   dog Bran, who lay at the entrance of the cave, his grief returns. Cathmor arranges the Iriſh army
   in order of battle. The appearance of that hero. The general conflict is deſcribed. The actions
   of Fingal and Cathmor. A ſtorm. The total rout of the Firbolg. The two kings engage, in a column
   of miſt, on the banks of Lubar. Their attitude and conference after the combat. The death of
   Cathmor. Fingal reſigns <i>the ſpear of Trenmor</i> to Oſſian. The ceremonies obſerved on that
   occaſion. The ſpirit of Cathmor, in the mean time, appears to Sul-malla, in the valley of Lona.
   Her ſorrow. Evening comes on. A feaſt is prepared. The coming of Ferad-artho is announced by the
   ſongs of a hundred bards. The poem cloſes, with a ſpeech of Fingal. </p>

   ſeized them, in ſtormy night, and cloathed them over with ice; white, to the hunter's early eye,
   the billows ſtill ſeem to roll. He turns his ear to the ſound of each unequal ridge. But each is
   ſilent, gleaming, ſtrewn with boughs and tufts of graſs, which ſhake and whiſtle to the wind,
   over their grey ſeats of froſt. So ſilent ſhone to the morning the ridges of Morven's hoſt, as
   each warrior looked up from his helmet towards the hill of the king; the cloud-covered hill of
   Fingal, where he ſtrode, in the folds of miſt. At times is the hero ſeen, greatly dim in all his

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Now</span> is the coming forth of the king. Firſt appeared the ſword of Luno; the

   came abroad, with all his grey, dewy locks in the wind ; then roſe the ſhouts of his hoſt over

   green ſeas round a ſpirit, that comes down from the ſqually wind. The traveller hears the ſound

   field. A little ſtream rolled at my feet: I touched its light wave, with my ſpear. I touched it

   <p class="noindent"> Conlath was the youngeſt of Morni's ſons, and brother to the celebrated Gaul. He was in love
    with Cuthóna the daughter of Rumar, when Toſcar the ſon of Kinfena, accompanied by Fercuth his
    friend, arrived, from Ireland, at Mora, where Conlath dwelt. He was hoſpitably received, and
    according to the cuſtom of the times, feaſted, three days, with Conlath. On the fourth he ſet
    ſail, and coaſting the <i>iſland of waves</i>, one of the Hebrides, he ſaw Cuthona hunting,
    fell in love with her, and carried her away, by force, in his ſhip. He was forced, by ſtreſs of
    weather, into I-thona a deſart iſle. In the mean-time Conlath, hearing of the rape, ſailed after
    him, and found him on the point of ſailing for the coaſt of Ireland. They fought; and they and
    their followers fell by mutual wounds. Cuthona did not long ſurvive: for ſhe died of grief the
    third day after. Fingal, hearing of their unfortunate death, ſent Stormal the ſon of Moran to
    bury them, but forgot to ſend a bard to ſing the funeral ſong over their tombs. The ghoſt of
    Conlath comes, long after, to Oſſian, to intreat him to tranſmit, to poſterity, his and
    Cuthona's fame. For it was the opinion of the times, that the ſouls of the deceaſed were not
    happy, till their elegies were compoſed by a bard. </p>

   <h3 class="normal">ARGUMENT.</h3>
   <p class="noindent"> Fingal in his voyage to Lochlin, whither he had been invited by Starno the father of
    Agandecca, touched at Berrathon, an iſland of Scandinavia, where he was kindly entertained by
    Larthmor the petty king of the place, who was a vaſſal of the ſupreme kings of Lochlin. The
    hoſpitality of Larthmor gained him Fingal's friendſhip, which that hero manifeſted, after the
    impriſonment of Larthmor by his own ſon, by ſending Oſſian and Toſcar, the father of Malvina ſo
    often mentioned, to reſcue Larthmor, and to puniſh the unnatural behaviour of Uthal. Uthal was
    handſome, and, by the ladies, much admired. Nina-thoma, the beautiful daughter of Torthoma, a
    neighbouring prince, fell in love and fled with him. He proved unconſtant; for another lady,
    whoſe name is not mentioned, gaining his affections, he confined Nina-thoma to a deſart iſland
    near the coaſt of Berrathon. She was relieved by Oſſian, who, in company with Toſcar, landing on
    Berrathon, defeated the forces of Uthal, and killed him in a ſingle combat. Nina-thoma, whoſe
    love not all the bad behaviour of Uthal could eraſe, hearing of his death, died of grief. In the
    mean time Larthmor is reſtored, and Oſſian and Toſcar return in triumph to Fingal,</p>
   <p class="noindent">The poem opens with an elegy on the death of Malvina the daughter of Toſcar, and cloſes with
    preſages of Oſſian's death. </p>

  <h3 class="normal">A DISSERTATION CONCERNING THE ÆRA of OSSIAN.</h3>
  <p class="noindent"> <span class="sc">Inquiries</span> into the antiquities of nations afford more pleaſure than any
   real advantage to mankind. The ingenious may form ſyſtems of hiſtory on probabilities and a few
   facts; but at a great diſtance of time, their accounts muſt be vague and uncertain. The infancy
   of ſtates and kingdoms is as deſtitute of great events, as of the means of tranſmitting them to
   poſterity: The arts of poliſhed life, by which alone facts can be preſerved with certainty, are
   the production of a well-formed community. It is then hiſtorians begin to write, and public
   tranſactions to be worthy remembrance. The actions of former times are left in obſcurity, or
   magnified by uncertain traditions, Hence it is that we find ſo

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> Greeks and Romans were remarkable for this weakneſs. They ſwallowed the
   moſt abſurd fables concerning the high antiquities of their reſpective nations. Good hiſtorians,
   however, roſe very early amongſt them, and tranſmitted, with luſtre, their great actions to
   poſterity. It is to them that they owe that unrivalled fame they now enjoy, while the great
   actions of other nations are involved in fables, or loſt in obſcurity. The Celtic nations afford
   a ſtriking inſtance of this kind, They, though once the maſters of Europe from the mouth of the

   of their bards, which, by the viciſſitude of human affairs, are long ſince loſt. Their ancient
   language is the only monument that remains of them ; and the traces of it being ſound in places
   ſo widely diſtant from each other, ſerves only to ſhew the extent of their ancient power, but
   throws very little light on their hiſtory.  </p>

    monarchy, as it was in all the countries where the Druids bore the
   chief ſway. This order of men ſeems to have been formed on the ſame principles with the Dactyli
   Idæi and Curetes of the ancients. Their pretended intercourſe with heaven, their magic and
   divination were the ſame. The knowlege of the Druids in natural cauſes, and the properties of
   certain things, the fruit of the experiments of ages, gained them a mighty reputation among the
   people. The eſteem of the populace ſoon increaſed into a veneration for the order; which theſe
   cunning and ambitious prieſts took care to improve, to ſuch a degree, that they, in a manner,
   ingroſſed the management of civil, as well as religious, matters. It is generally allowed that
   they did not abuſe this extraordinary power ; the preſerving their character of ſanctity was ſo
   eſſential to their influence, that they never broke out into violence or oppreſſion. The chiefs
   were allowed to execute the laws, but the legiſlative power was entirely in the hands of the
   Druids<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753334568448"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>. It was by their authority that the tribes were united, in times of the

    enjoyed long this extraordinary privilege among the
   Celtic nations who lay beyond the pale of the Roman empire. It was in the beginning of the ſecond
   century that their power among the Caledonians begun to decline. The traditions concerning
   Trathal and Cormac, anceſtors to Fingal, are full of the particulars of the fall of the Druids: a
   fingular fate, it muſt be owned, of prieſts, who had once eſtabliſhed their ſuperſtition !</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> continual wars of the Caledonians againſt the Romans hindered the better
   ſort from initiating themſelves, as the cuſtom formerly was, into the order of the Druids. The
   precepts of their religion were confined to a few, and were not much attended to by a people
   inured to war. The Vergobretus, or chief magiſtrate, was choſen without the concurrence of the
   hierarchy, or continued in his office againſt their will. Continual power ſtrengthened his
   intereſt among the tribes, and enabled him to ſend down, as hereditary to his poſterity, the
   office he had only received himſelf by election.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">On</span> occaſion of a new war againſt the <i>King of the World</i>, as
   tradition emphatically calls the Roman emperor, the Druids, to vindicate the honour of the order,
   began to reſume their ancient privilege of chuſing the Vergobretus. Garmal, the ſon of Tarno,

    them, came to the grandfather of the celebrated Fingal, who was then
   Vergobretus, and commanded him, in the name of the whole order, to lay down his office. Upon his
   refuſal, a civil war commenced, which ſoon ended in almoſt the total extinction of the religious
   order of the Druids. A few that remained, retired to the dark receſſes of their groves, and the
   caves they had formerly uſed for their meditations. It is then we find them in <i>the circle of
   ſtones</i>, and unheeded by the world. A total diſregard for the order, and utter abhorrence of
   the Druidical rites enſued. Under this cloud of public hate, all that had any knowlege of the
   religion of the Druids became extinct, and the nation fell into the laft degree of ignorance of
   their rites and ceremonies.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">It</span> is no matter of wonder then, that Fingal and his ſon Oſſian diſliked the
   Druids, who were the declared enemies to their ſucceſſion in the ſupreme magiſtracy. It is a
   fingular caſe, it muſt be allowed, that there are no traces of religion in the poems aſcribed to
   Oſſian ; as the poetical compoſitions of other nations are fo cloſely connected with their
   mythology. But gods are not neceſſary, when the poet has genius. It is hard to account for it to
   thoſe who are not made acquainted with the manner of the old Scottiſh

    bards. That race of men carried their notions of
   martial honour to an extravagant pitch. Any aid given their heroes in battle, was thought to
   derogate from their fame ; and the bards immediately transferred the glory of the action to him
   who had given that aid.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Had</span> the poet brought down gods, as often as Homer hath done, to aſſiſt his
   heroes, his work had not conſiſted of eulogiums on men, but of hymns to ſuperior beings. Thoſe
   who write in the Galic language ſeldom mention religion in their profane poetry ; and when they
   profeſſedly write of religion, they never mix with their compoſitions, the actions of their
   heroes, This cuſtom alone, even though the religion of the Druids had not been previouſly
   extinguiſhed, may, in ſome meaſure, excuſe the author's ſilence concerning the religion of
   ancient times.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">To</span> allege, that a nation is void of all religion, would betray ignorance of
   the hiſtory of mankind. The traditions of their fathers, and their own obſervations on the works
   of nature, together with that ſuperſtition which is inherent in the human frame, have, in all
   ages, raiſed in the minds of men ſome idea of a ſuperior being. Hence it is, that in the darkeſt

    notion, at leaſt, of a divinity. The Indians, who worſhip no God,
   believe that he exiſts. It would be doing injuſtice to the author of theſe poems, to think, that
   he had not opened his conceptions to that primitive and greateſt of all truths. But let his
   religion be what it will, it is certain he has not alluded to Chriſtianity, or any of its rites,
   in his poems ; which ought to fix his opinions, at leaſt, to an æra prior to that religion.
   Conjectures, on this ſubject, muſt ſupply the place of proof. The perſecution begun by
   Dioclefian, in the year 303, is the moſt probable time in which the firſt dawning of Chriſtianity
   in the north of Britain can be fixed. The humane and mild character of Conſtantius Chlorus, who
   commanded then in Britain, induced the perſecuted Chriftians to take refuge under him. Some of
   them, through a zeal to propagate their tenets, or through fear, went beyond the pale of the
   Roman empire, and ſettled among the Caledonians; who were ready to hearken to their doctrines, if
   the religion of the Druids was exploded long before.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">These</span> miſſionaries, either through choice, or to give more weight to the
   doctrine they advanced, took poſſeſſion of the cells and groves of the Druids; and it was from
   this retired life they had the name of <i>Culdees</i><a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753334546192"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>, which in the

    language of the country ſignified <i>ſequeſtered
   perſons</i>. It was with one of the <i>Culdees</i> that Oſſian, in his extreme old age, is
   ſaid to have diſputed concerning the Chriftian religion. This diſpute, they ſay, is extant, and
   is couched in verſe, according to the cuſtom of the times. The extreme ignorance on the part of
   Oſſian, of the Chriſtian tenets, ſhews, that that religion had only been lately introduced, as it
   is not eafy to conceive, how one of the firſt rank could be totally unacquainted with a religion
   that had been known for any time in the country. The diſpute bears the genuine marks of
   antiquity. The obſolete phraſes and expreſſions peculiar to the times, prove it to be no forgery.
   If Oſſian then lived at the introduction of Chriſtianity, as by all appearance he did, his epoch
   will be the latter end of the third, and beginning of the fourth century. Tradition here ſteps in

   the poſſeſſions they had loſt. The enraged emperor commanded his army to march into their
   country, and to deſtroy it with fire and ſword. His orders were but ill executed, for his ſon,

   Romans ; but the two juſt mentioned clearly fix the epocha of Fingal to the third century ; and
   this account agrees exactly with the Iriſh hiſtories, which place the death of Fingal, the ſon of

    by tradition, from learned men, more than from ancient poems. This

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Every</span> one knows what a cloud of ignorance and barbariſm overſpread the north
   of Europe three hundred years ago. The minds of men, addicted to ſuperſtition, contracted a
   narrowneſs that deſtroyed genius. Accordingly we find the compoſitions of thoſe times trivial and
   puerile to the laſt degree. But let it be allowed, that, amidſt all the untoward circumſtances of
   the age, a genius might ariſe, it is not eaſy to determine what could induce him to allude to the
   Roman times. We find no fact to favour any deſigns which could be entertained by any man who
   lived in the fifteenth century.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſtrongeſt objection to the antiquity of the poems now given to the
   public under the name of Oſſian, is the improbability of their being handed down by tradition
   through ſo many centuries. Ages of barbariſm ſome will ſay, could not produce poems abounding
   with the diſintereſted and generous ſentiments ſo conſpicuous in the compoſitions of Oſſian; and

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">These</span> objections naturally ſuggeſt themſelves to men unacquainted with the
   ancient ſtate of the northern parts of Britain. The bards, who were an inferior order of the
   Druids, did not ſhare their bad fortune. They were ſpared by the victorious king, as it was
   through their means only he could hope for immortality to his fame. They attended him in the
   camp, and contributed to eſtabliſh his power by their ſongs. His great actions were magnified,
   and the populace, who had no ability to examine into his character narrowly, were dazzled with
   his fame in the rhimes of the bards. In the mean time, men aſſumed ſentiments that are rarely to
   be met with in an age of barbariſm. The bards who were originally the diſciples of the Druids,
   had their minds opened, and their ideas enlarged, by being initiated in the learning of that
   celebrated order. They could form a perfect hero in their own minds, and aſcribe that character
   to their prince. The inferior chiefs made this ideal character the model of their conduct, and by
   degrees brought their minds to that generous ſpirit which breathes in all the poetry of the
   times. The prince, flattered by his bards, and rivalled by his own heroes, who imitated his
   character as deſcribed in the eulogies of his poets, endeavoured to excel his people in merit,

   laſt the general character of the nation, happily compounded of what is noble in barbarity, and
   virtuous and generous in a poliſhed people.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">When</span> virtue in peace, and bravery in war, are the characteriſtics of a
   nation, their actions become intereſting, and their fame worthy of immortality. A generous ſpirit
   is warmed with noble actions, and becomes ambitious of perpetuating them. This is the true ſource
   of that divine inſpiration, to which the poets of all ages pretended. When they found their
   themes inadequate to the warmth of their imaginations, they varniſhed them over with fables,
   ſupplied by their own fancy, or furniſhed by abſurd traditions. Theſe fables, however ridiculous,
   had their abettors; poſterity either implicitly believed them, or through a vanity natural to
   mankind, pretended that they did. They loved to place the founders of their families in the days
   of fable, when poetry, without the fear of contradiction, could give what characters ſhe pleaſed
   of her heroes. It is to this vanity that we owe the preſervation of what remain of the more
   ancient poems. Their poetical merit made their heroes famous in a country where heroiſm was much

    heroes, or thoſe who pretended to be deſcended from
   them, heard with pleaſure the eulogiums of their anceſtors ; bards were employed to repeat the
   poems, and to record the connection of their patrons with chiefs ſo renowned. Every chief in
   proceſs of time had a bard in his family, and the office became at laſt hereditary. By the
   ſucceſſion of theſe bards, the poems concerning the anceſtors of the family were handed down from
   generation to generation; they were repeated to the whole clan on ſolemn occaſions, and always
   alluded to in the new compoſitions of the bards. This cuſtom came down to near our own times; and
   after the bards were diſcontinued, a great number in a clan retained by memory, or committed to
   writing, their compoſitions, and founded the antiquity of their families on the authority of
   their poems.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> uſe of letters was not known in the north of Europe till long after the
   inſtitution of the bards : the records of the families of their patrons, their own, and more
   ancient poems were handed down by tradition. Their poetical compoſitions were admirably contrived
   for that purpoſe. They were adapted to muſic; and the moſt perfect harmony was obſerved. Each

    remembered in a ſtanza, it was almoſt impoſſible to forget the reſt.
   The cadences followed in ſo natural a gradation, and the words were ſo adapted to the common turn
   of the voice, after it is raiſed to a certain key, that it was almoſt impoſſible, from a
   ſimilarity of ſound, to ſubſtitute one word for another. This excellence is peculiar to the
   Celtic tongue, and is perhaps to be met with in no other language. Nor does this choice of words
   clog the ſenſe or weaken the expreſſion. The numerous flections of conſonants, and variation in
   declenſion, make the language very copious.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> deſcendants of the Celtæ, who inhabited Britain and its iſles, were not
   ſingular in this method of preſerving the moſt precious monuments of their nation. The ancient
   laws of the Greeks were couched in verſe, and handed down by tradition. The Spartans, through a
   long habit, became ſo fond of this cuſtom, that they would never allow their laws to be committed
   to writing. The actions of great men, and the eulogiums of kings and heroes, were preſerved in
   the ſame manner. All the hiſtorical monuments of the old Germans were comprehended in their
   ancient ſongs<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753334503472"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>! which were either hymns to their gods, or elegies in

    and were intended to perpetuate the great events in
   their nation which were carefully interwoven with them. This ſpecies of compoſition was not
   committed to writing, but delivered by oral tradition<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753334500688"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>. The care they took to
   have the poems taught to their children, the uninterrupted cuſtom of repeating them upon certain
   occaſions, and the happy meaſure of the verſe, ſerved to preſerve them for a long time
   uncorrupted. This oral chronicle of the Germans was not forgot in the eighth century, and it
   probably would have remained to this day, had not learning, which thinks every thing, that is not
   committed to writing, fabulous, been introduced. It was from poetical traditions that Garcillaſſo
   compoſed his account of the Yncas of Peru. The Peruvians had loft all other monuments of their
   hiſtory, and it was from ancient poems which his mother, a princeſs of the blood of the Yncas,
   taught him in his youth, that he collected the materials of his hiſtory. If other nations then,
   that had been often overrun by enemies, and had ſent abroad and received colonies, could, for
   many ages, preſerve, by oral tradition, their laws and hiſtories uncorrupted, it is much more
   probable that the ancient Scots, a people ſo free of intermixture

   conjecture. Beyond the reach of records, is ſettled a gloom, which no ingenuity can penetrate.
   The manners deſcribed, in theſe poems, ſuit the ancient Celtic times, and no other period, that
   is known in hiſtory. We muſt, therefore, place the heroes far back in antiquity; and it matters
   little, who were their contemporaries in other parts of the world. If we have placed Fingal in
   his proper period, we do honour to the manners of barbarous times. He exercifed every manly
   virtue in Caledonia, while Heliogabalus diſgraced human nature at Rome. </p>

  <h3 class="normal">A DISSERTATION CONCERNING THE POEMS of OSSIAN.</h3>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> hiſtory of thoſe nations, who originally poſſeſſed the north of Europe,
   is leſs known than their manners. Deſtitute of the uſe of letters, they themſelves had not the
   means of tranſmitting their great actions to remote poſterity. Foreign writers ſaw them only at a
   diſtance, and deſcribed them as they found them. The vanity of the Romans induced them to
   conſider the nations beyond the pale of their empire as barbarians; and conſequently their
   hiſtory unworthy of being inveſtigated. Their manners and fingular character were matters of
   curioſity, as they committed them to record. Some men, otherwiſe of great merit among ourſelves,
   give into confined ideas on

    this ſubject. Having early imbibed their idea of
   exalted manners from the Greek and Roman writers, they ſcarcely ever afterwards have the
   fortitude to allow any dignity of character to any nation deſtitute of the uſe of letters.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Without</span> derogating from the fame of Greece and Rome, we may conſider
   antiquity beyond the pale of their empire worthy of ſome attention. The nobler paſſions of the
   mind never ſhoot forth more free and unreſtrained than in the times we call barbarous. That
   irregular manner of life, and thoſe manly purſuits from which barbarity takes its name, are
   highly favorable to a ſtrength of mind unknown in poliſhed times. In advanced ſociety the
   characters of men are more uniform and diſguiſed. The human paſſions lie in ſome degree concealed
   behind forms, and artificial manners; and the powers of the ſoul, without an opportunity of
   exerting them, loſe their vigor. The times of regular government, and poliſhed manners, are
   therefore to be wiſhed for by the feeble and weak in mind. An unſettled ſtate, and thoſe
   convulſions which attend it, is the proper field for an exalted character, and the exertion of
   great parts. Merit there riſes always ſuperior ; no fortuitous event can raiſe the timid and mean
   into power. To thoſe who look upon antiquity in this light,

    it is an agreeable proſpect ; and they alone can have real pleaſure
   in tracing nations to their ſource.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> eſtabliſhment of the Celtic ſtates, in the north of Europe, is beyond
   the reach of written annals. The traditions and ſongs to which they truſted their hiſtory, were
   loſt, or altogether corrupted in their revolutions and migrations, which were ſo frequent and
   univerſal, that no kingdom in Europe is now poſſefed by its original inhabitants. Societies were
   formed, and kingdoms erected, from a mixture of nations, who, in proceſs of time, loſt all
   knowlege of their own origin. If tradition could be depended upon, it is only among a people,
   from all time, free from intermixture with foreigners. We are to look for theſe among the
   mountains and inacceſfible parts of a country : places, on account of their barrenneſs,
   uninviting to an enemy, or whoſe natural ſtrength enabled the natives to repel invaſions. Such
   are the inhabitants of the mountains of Scotland. We, accordingly, find, that they differ
   materially from thoſe who poſſeſs the low and more fertile part of the kingdom. Their language is
   pure and original, and their manners are thoſe of an ancient and unmixed race of men. Conſcious
   of their own antiquity, they long deſpiſed others, as a new and mixed

    people. As they lived in a country only fit for
   paſture, they were free from that toil and buſineſs, which engroſs the attention of a commercial
   people. Their amuſement conſiſted in hearing or repeating their ſongs and traditions, and theſe
   intirely turned on the antiquity of their nation, and the exploits of their forefathers. It is no
   wonder, therefore, that there are more remains of antiquity among them, than among any other
   people in Europe. Traditions, however, concerning remote periods, are only to be regarded, in ſo
   far as they co-incide with cotemporary writers of undoubted credit and veracity.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">No</span> writers began their accounts from a more early period, than the
   hiſtorians of the Scots nation. Without records, or even tradition itſelf, they give a long liſt
   of ancient kings, and a detail of their tranſactions, with a ſcrupulous exactneſs. One might
   naturally ſuppoſe, that, when they had no authentic annals, they ſhould, at leaſt, have recourſe
   to the traditions of their country, and have reduced them into a regular ſyſtem of hiſtory. Of
   both they ſeem to have been equally deſtitute. Born in the low country, and ſtrangers to the
   ancient language of their nation, they contented themſelves with copying from one another, and

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">John Fordunn</span> was the firſt who collected thoſe fragments of the Scots
   hiſtory, which had eſcaped the brutal policy of Edward I. and reduced them into order. His
   accounts, in ſo far as they concerned recent tranſactions, deſerved credit : beyond a certain
   period, they were fabulous and unſatisfactory. Some time before Fordun wrote, the king of
   England, in a letter to the pope, had run up the antiquity of his nation to a very remote æra.
   Fordun, poſſeſſed of all the national prejudice of the age, was unwilling that his country ſhould
   yield, in point of antiquity, to a people, then its rivals and enemies. Deſtitute of annals in
   Scotland, he had recourſe to Ireland, which, according to the vulgar errors of the times, was
   reckoned the firſt habitation of the Scots. He found, there, that the Iriſh bards had carried
   their pretenſions to antiquity as high, if not beyond any nation in Europe. It was from them he
   took thoſe improbable fictions, which form the firſt part of his hiſtory.</p>

    traditions of their country, their hiſtories contain
   little information concerning the origin of the Scots. Even Buchanan himſelf, except the elegance
   and vigour of his ſtile, has very little to recommend him. Blinded with political prejudices, he
   ſeemed more anxious to turn the fictions of his predeceſſors to his own purpoſes, than to detect
   their miſrepreſentations, or inveſtigate truth amidſt the darkneſs which they had thrown round
   it. It therefore appears, that little can be collected from their own hiſtorians, concerning the
   firſt migration of the Scots into Britain. </p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">That</span> this iſland was peopled from Gaul admits of no doubt. Whether colonies
   came afterwards from the north of Europe is a matter of meer ſpeculation. When South-Britain
   yielded to the power of the Romans, the unconquered nations to the north of the province were
   diſtinguiſhed by the name of <i>Caledonians</i>. From their very name, it appears, that they
   were of thoſe Gauls, who poſſeſſed themſelves originally of Britain. It is compounded of two
   <i>Celtic</i> words, <i>Caël</i> ſignifying <i>Celts</i>, or <i>Gauls</i>, and
   <i>Dun</i> or <i>Don</i>, a hill; ſo that <i>Caël-don</i>, or Caledonians, is as much as to
   ſay, the <i>Celts of the hill country</i>. The Highlanders, to this day, call themſelves
   <i>Caël</i>, their language <i>Caëlic</i>, or <i>Galic</i>, and their country

   <i>Caledonia</i>. This, of itſelf, is ſufficient to demonſtrate, they are the genuine
   deſcendents of the ancient Caledonians, and not a pretended colony of <i>Scots</i>, who ſettled
   firſt in the north, in the third or fourth century.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">From</span> the double meaning of the word <i>Caël</i>, which ſignifies
   <i>ſtrangers</i>, as well as <i>Gauls</i>,or <i>Celts</i>, ſome have imagined, that the
   anceſtors of the Caledonians were of a different race from the reſt of the Britons, and that they
   received their name upon that account. This opinion, ſay they, is ſupported by Tacitus, who, from
   ſeveral circumſtances, concludes, that the Caledonians were of German extraction. A diſcuſſion of
   a point ſo intricate, at this diſtance of time, could neither be fatisfaſtory nor important.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Towards</span> the latter end of the third, and beginning of the fourth century, we

   the Scots were not heard of before that period, moſt writers ſuppoſed them to have been a colony,

    Caledonians, in proceſs of time, became naturally
   divided into two diſtinct nations, as poſſeſſing parts of the country, intirely different in
   their nature and ſoil. The weſtern coaſt of Scotland is hilly and barren ; towards the eaſt the
   country is plain, and fit for tillage. The inhabitants of the mountains, a roving and
   uncontrouled race of men, lived by feeding of cattle, and what they killed in hunting. Their
   employment did not fix them to one place. They removed from one heath to another, as ſuited beſt
   with their convenience or inclination. They were not, therefore, improperly called, by their
   neighbours, <span class="sc">Scuite</span>, or <i>the wandering nation</i> ; wiuch is evidently the
   origin of the Roman name of <i>Scoti</i>.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">On</span> the other hand, the Caledonians, who poſſeſſed the eaſt coaſt of
   Scotland, as the diviſion of the country was plain and fertile, applied themſelves to
   agriculture, and raiſing of corn. It was from this, that the Galic name of the <i>Picts</i>
   proceeded; for they are called, in that language, <i>Cruithnich</i>, i. e. <i>the wheat or
   corn-eaters</i>. As the Picts lived in a country ſo different in its nature from that poſſeſſed
   by the Scots, ſo their national character ſuffered a material change. Unobſtructed by mountains,
   or lakes, their communication with one another was free and frequent.

    Society, therefore, became ſooner eſtabliſhed among them, than
   among the Scots, and, conſequently, they were much ſooner governed by civil magiſtrates and laws.
   This, at laſt, produced ſo great a difference in the manners of the two nations, that they began
   to forget their common origin, and almoſt continual quarrels and animoſities ſubſiſted between
   them. Theſe animoſities, after ſome ages, ended in the ſubverſion of the Pictiſh kingdom, but not
   in the total extirpation of the nation, according to moſt of the Scots writers, who ſeemed to
   think it more for the honour of their countrymen to annihilate, than reduce a rival people under
   their obedience. It is certain, however, that the very name of the Picts was loſt, and thoſe that
   remained were ſo completely incorporated with their conquerors, that they ſoon loſt all memory of
   their own origin.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> end of the Pictiſh government is placed ſo near that period, to which
   authentic annals reach, that it is matter of wonder, that we have no monuments of their language
   or hiſtory remaining. This favours the ſyſtem I have laid down. Had they originally been of a
   different race from the Scots, their language of courſe would be different. The contrary is the

    and the very names of their kings, which are handed
   down to us, are of Galic original, which is a convincing proof, that the two nations were, of
   old, one and the ſame, and only divided into two governments, by the effect which their ſituation
   had upon the genius of the people.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> name of <i>Picts</i> is ſaid to have been given by the Romans to the
   Caledonians, who poſſeſſed the eaſt coaſt of Scotland, from their painting their bodies. The
   ſtory is ſilly and the argument abſurd. But let us revere antiquity in her very follies. This
   circumſtance made ſome imagine, that the Picts were of Britiſh extract, and a different race of
   men from the Scots. That more of the Britons, who fled northward from the tyranny of the Romans,
   ſettled in the low country of Scotland, than among the Scots of the mountains, may be eaſily
   imagined, from the very nature of the country. It was they who introduced painting among the
   Picts. From this circumſtance, affirm ſome antiquaries, proceeded the name of the latter, to
   diſtinguiſh them from the Scots, who never had that art among them, and from the Britons, who
   diſcontinued it after the Roman conqueſt.</p>

   dangerous firths. It is, therefore, highly probable, that they, very early, found their way to
   the north of Ireland, which is within ſight of their own country. That Ireland was firſt peopled
   from Britain is, at length, a matter that admits of no doubt. The vicinity of the two iſlands;
   the exact correſpondence of the ancient inhabitants of both, in point of manners and language,
   are ſufficient proofs, even if we had not the teſtimony of<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753334429552"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a> authors of undoubted veracity to confirm it. The abettors of the
   moſt romantic ſyſtems of Iriſh antiquities allow it; but they place the colony from Britain in an
   improbable and remote æra. I ſhall eaſily admit, that the colony of the <i>Firbolg</i>,
   confeſſedly the Belgæ of Britain, ſettled in the ſouth of Ireland, before the Caël, or
   Caledonians, diſcovered the north; but it is not at all likely, that the migration of the Firbolg
   to Ireland happened many centuries before the chriſtian æra.</p>

    inhabitants of Ireland, that eyery unbiaſſed perſon
   will confeſs them more probable, than the legends handed down, by tradition, in that country. It
   appears, that, in the days of Trathal, grandfather to Fingal, Ireland was poſſeſſed by two
   nations; the <i>Firbolg</i> or <i>Belgæ</i> of Britain, who inhabited the ſouth, and the
   Caël, who paſſed over from Caledonia and the Hebrides to Ulfter. The two nations, as is uſual
   among an unpoliſhed and lately ſettled people, were divided into ſmall dynaſties, ſubject to
   petty kings, or chiefs, independent of one another. In this ſituation, it is probable, they
   continued long, without any material revolution in the ſtate of the iſland, until Crothar, Lord
   of Atha, a country in Connaught, the moſt potent chief of the <i>Firbolg</i>, carried away
   Conlama, the daughter of Cathmin, a chief of the Caël, who poſſeſſed Ulſter.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Conlama</span> had been betrothed ſome time before to Turloch, a chief of their own
   nation. Turloch reſented the affront offered him by Crothar, made an irruption into Connaught,
   and killed Cormul, the brother of Crothar, who came to oppoſe his progreſs. Crothar himſelf then
   took arms, and either killed or expelled Turloch. The war, upon this, became general, between the

    reduced to the laſt extremity. In this ſituation, they applied, for
   aid, to Trathal king of Morven, who ſent his brother Conar, already famous for his great
   exploits, to their relief. Conar, upon his arrival in Ulfter, was choſen king, by the unanimous
   conſent of the Caledonian tribes, who poſſeſſed that country. The war was renewed with vigour and
   ſucceſs; but the Firbolg appear to have been rather repelled than ſubdued. In ſucceeding reigns,
   we learn from epiſodes in the ſame poem, that the chiefs of Atha made ſeveral efforts to become
   monarchs of Ireland, and to expel the race of Conar.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">To</span> Conar ſucceeded his ſon Cormac, who appears to have reigned long. In his
   latter days he ſeems to have been driven to the laſt extremity, by an inſurrection of the
   <i>Firbolg</i>, who ſupported the pretenſions of the chiefs of Atha to the Iriſh throne.
   Fingal, who then was very young, came to the aid of Cormac, totally defeated Colc-ulla, chief of
   Atha, and re-eſtabliſhed Cormac in the ſole poſſeſſion of all Ireland. It was then he fell in

   ſubject of the poem of <i>Fingal</i>. The family of Atha, who had not relinquiſhed their
   pretenflons to the Iriſh throne, rebelled in the minority of Cormac, defeated his adherents, and
   murdered him in the palace of Temora. Cairbar, lord of Atha, upon this, mounted the throne. His
   uſurpation ſoon ended with his life; for Fingal made an expedition into Ireland, and reſtored,
   after various viciſſitudes of fortune, the family of Conar to the poſſeſſion of the kingdom. This
   war is the ſubject of Temora; the events, though certainly heightened and embelliſhed by poetry,
   ſeem, notwithſtanding, to have their ſoundation in true hiſtory.</p>

   the firſt king of Ireland, we can form no judgment of the time of the ſettlement of the Firbolg.
   It is, however, probable, it was ſome time before the Caël, or Caledonians, ſettled in Ulfter.
   One important fact may be gathered from this hiſtory, that the Iriſh had no king before the
   latter end of the firſt century. Fingal lived, it is ſuppoſed, in the third century ; ſo Conar,
   the firſt monarch of the Iriſh, who was his grand-uncle, cannot be placed farther back than the
   cloſe of the firſt. To eſtabliſh this fact, is to lay, at once, aſide the pretended antiquities
   of the Scots and Iriſh, and to get quit of the long liſt of kings which the latter give us for a
   millennium before.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Of</span> the affairs of Scotiand, it is certain, nothing can be depended upon,
   prior to the reign of Fergus, the ſon of Erc, who lived in the fifth century. The true hiſtory of

    this conſideration, that he begins his hiſtory at the
   introduction of Chriſtianity, remarking, that all that is delivered down, concerning the times of
   paganiſm, were tales of late invention, ſtrangely mixed with anachroniſms and inconſiſtencies.
   Such being the opinion of Ware, who had collected with uncommon induſtry and zeal, all the real
   and pretendedly antient manuſcripts, concerning the hiſtory of his country, we may, on his
   authority, reject the improbable and ſelf-condemned tales of Keating and O'Flaherty. Credulous
   and puerile to the laſt degree, they have diſgraced the antiquities they meant to eſtabliſh. It
   is to be wiſhed, that ſome able Iriſhman, who underſtands the language and records of his
   country, may redeem, ere it is too late, the genuine antiquities of Ireland, from the hands of
   theſe idle fabuliſts.</p>

   Some trace up the family of Fergus to a ſon of Fingal of that name, who makes a conſiderable
   figure in Oſſian's poems. The three elder ſons of Fingal, Oſſian, Fillan, and Ryno, dying without
   iſſue, the ſucceſſion, of courſe, devolved upon Fergus, the fourth ſon and his poſterity. This

   laſt, have leiſure to cultivate the mind, and to reſtore it, with reflection, to a primæval
   dignity of ſentiment. The middle ſtate is the region of complete barbariſm and ignorance. About
   the beginning of the fifth century, the Scots and Picts were advanced into the ſecond ſtage, and,
   conſequently, into thoſe circumſcribed ſentiments, which always diſtinguiſh barbarity. The events
   which ſoon after happened did not at all contribute to enlarge their ideas, or mend their
   national character.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">About</span> the year 425, the Romans, on account of domeſtic commotions, entirely
   forſook Britain, finding it impoſſible to defend ſo diſtant a frontier, The Picts and Scots,
   ſeizing this favourable opportunity, made incurſions into the deſerted province. The Britons,

    the ſlavery of ſeveral centuries, and thoſe vices, which are
   inſeparable from an advanced ſtate of civility, were not able to withſtand the impetuous, though
   irregular attacks of a barbarous enemy. In the utmoſt diſtreſs, they applied to their old
   maſters, the Romans, and (after the unfortunate ſtate of the Empire could not ſpare aid) to the
   Saxons, a nation equally barbarous and brave, with the enemies of whom they were ſo much afraid.
   Though the bravery of the Saxons repelled the Caledonian nations for a time, yet the latter found
   means to extend themſelves, conſiderably, towards the ſouth. It is, in this period, we muſt place
   the origin of the arts of Civil life among the Scots. The ſeat of government was removed from the
   mountains to the plain and more fertile provinces of the South, to be near the common enemy, in
   caſe of ſudden incurſions. Inſtead of roving through unfrequented wilds, in ſearch of
   ſubſiſtance, by means of hunting, men applied to agriculture, and raiſing of corn. This manner of
   life was the firſt means of changing the national character. The next thing which contributed to
   it was their mixture with ſtrangers.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> the countries which the Scots had conquered from the Britons, it is

    incorporating with the conquerors, taught them
   agriculture, and other arts, which they themſelves had received from the Romans. The Scots,
   however, in number as well as power, being the moſt predominant, retained ſtill their language,
   and as many of the cuſtoms of their anceſtors, as ſuited with the nature of the country they
   poſſeſſed. Even the union of the two Caledonian kingdoms did not much affect the national
   character. Being originally deſcended from the ſame ſtock, the manners of the Picts and Scots
   were as ſimilar as the different natures of the countries they poſſefſed permitted.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">What</span> brought about a total change in the genius of the Scots nation, was
   their wars, and other tranſactions with the Saxons. Several counties in the ſouth of Scotland
   were alternately poſſeſſed by the two nations. They were ceded, in the ninth age, to the Scots,
   and, it is probable, that moſt of the Saxon inhabitants remained in poſſeſſion of their lands.
   During the ſeveral conqueſts and revolutions in England, many fled, for refuge, into Scotland, to
   avoid the oppreſſion of foreigners, or the tyranny of domeſtic uſurpers ; in ſo much, that the
   Saxon race formed perhaps near one half of the Scottiſh kingdom. The Saxon manners and language
   daily gained ground, on the tongue and

   entirely relegated to inhabitants of the mountains, who were ſtill unmixed with ſtrangers.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">It</span> was after the acceſſion of territory which the Scots received, upon the
   retreat of the Romans from Britain, that the inhabitants of the Highlands were divided into
   clans. The king, when he kept his court in the mountains, was conſidered, by the whole nation, as
   the chief of their blood. Their ſmall number, as well as the preſence of their prince, prevented
   thoſe diviſions, which, afterwards, ſprung forth into ſo many ſeparate tribes. When the ſeat of
   government was removed to the ſouth, thoſe who remained in the Highlands were, of courſe,
   neglected. They naturally formed themſelves into ſmall ſocieties, independent of one another.
   Each ſociety had its own <i>regulus</i>, who either was, or in the ſucceſſion of a few
   generations, was regarded as chief of their blood. The nature of the country favoured an
   inſtitution of this ſort. A few valleys, divided from one another by extenſive heaths and
   impaſſible mountains, form the face of the Highlands. In theſe valleys the chiefs fixed their
   reſidence. Round them, and almoſt within ſight of their dwellings, were the habitations of their
   relations and dependents.</p>

    <span class="sc">The</span> ſeats of the Highland chiefs
   were neither diſagreeable nor inconvenient. Surrounded with mountains and hanging woods, they
   were covered from the inclemency of the weather. Near them generally ran a pretty large river,
   which, diſcharging itſelf not far off, into an arm of the ſea, or extenſive lake, ſwarmed with
   variety of fiſh. The woods were ſtocked with wild-fowl ; and the heaths and mountains behind them
   were the natural ſeat of the red-deer and roe. If we make allowance for the backward ſtate of
   agriculture, the valleys were not unfertile ; affording, if not all the conveniencies, at leaſt
   the neceſſaries of life. Here the chief lived, the ſupreme judge and law-giver of his own people
   ; but his ſway was neither ſevere nor unjuſt. As the populace regarded him as the chief of their
   blood, ſo he, in return, conſidered them as members of his family. His commands therefore, though
   abſolute and decifive, partook more of the authority of a father, than of the rigor of a judge.
   Though the whole territory of the tribe was conſidered as the property of the chief, yet his
   vaſſals made him no other conſideration for their lands than ſervices, neither burdenſome nor
   frequent. As he ſeldom went from home, he was at no expense. His table

   killed in hunting.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> this rural kind of magnificence, the Highland chiefs lived, for many
   ages. At a diſtance from the ſeat of government, and ſecured, by the inacceſſibleneſs of their
   country, they were free and independent. As they had little communication with ſtrangers, the
   cuſtoms of their anceſtors remained among them, and their language retained its original purity.
   Naturally fond of military fame, and remarkably attached to the memory of their anceſtors, they
   delighted in traditions and ſongs, concerning the exploits of their nation, and eſpecially of
   their own particular families. A ſucceſſion of bards was retained in every clan, to hand down the
   memorable actions of their forefathers. As Fingal and his chiefs were the moſt renowned names in
   tradition, the bards took care to place them in the genealogy of every great family. They became
   famous among the people, and an object of fiction and poetry to the bards.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> bards erected their immediate patrons into heroes, and celebrated them

   noble and univerſal ; neither gives he, I preſume, ſo many of thoſe peculiarities, which are only
   underſtood in a certain period or country. The other bards have their beauties, but not in this
   ſpecies of compoſition. Their rhimes, only calculated to kindle a martial ſpirit among the
   vulgar, afford very little pleaſure to genuine taſte. This obſervation only regards their poems
   of the heroic kind; in every inferior ſpecies of poetry they are more ſucceſsful. They expreſs
   the tender melancholy of deſponding love, with ſimplicity and nature. So well adapted are the
   ſounds of the words to the ſentiments, that, even without any knowledge of the language they
   pierce and diſſolve the heart. Succeſsful love is expreſſed with peculiar tenderneſs and
   elegance. In all their compoſitions, except the heroic, which was ſolely calculated to animate
   the vulgar, they give us the genuine language of the heart, without any of thoſe affected
   ornaments of phraſeology, which, tho' intended to beautify ſentiments, diveſt them of their
   natural force. The ideas, it is confeſſed,

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">It</span> was the locality of their deſcription and ſentiment, that, probably, has
   kept them hitherto in the obſcurity of an almoſt loſt language. The ideas of an unpoliſhed period
   are ſo contrary to the preſent advanced ſtate of ſociety, that more than a common mediocrity of
   taſte is required, to reliſh them as they deſerve. Thoſe who alone are capable of transferring
   ancient poetry into a modern language, might be better employed in giving originals of their own,

    ſubject and cataſtrophe of the poem are founded upon
   facts, which regarded the firſt peopling of that country, and the conteſts between the two
   Britiſh nations, who originally inhabited that iſland. In a preceding part of this Diſſertation,
   I have ſhewn how ſuperior the probability of this ſyſtem is to the undigeſted fictions of the
   Iriſh bards, and the more recent and regular legends of both Iriſh and Scottiſh hiſtorians. I
   mean not to give offence to the abettors of the high antiquities of the two nations, though I
   have all along expreſſed my doubts, concerning the veracity and abilities of thoſe who deliver
   down their antient hiſtory. For my own part, I prefer the national fame, ariſing from a few
   certain facts, to the legendary and uncertain annals of ages of remote and obſcure antiquity. No
   kingdom now eſtabliſhed in Europe can pretend to equal antiquity with that of the Scots,
   inconſiderable as it may appear in other reſpects, even according to my ſyſtem, ſo that it is
   altogether needleſs to fix its origin a fictitious millennium before.</p>

   my genius ; and were even the allegation true, my ſelf-denial might have atoned for my fault.
   Without vanity I ſay it, I think I could write tolerable poetry ; and I aſſure my antagoniſts,
   that I ſhould not tranſlate what I could not imitate.</p>
  <p class="noindent">As prejudice is the effect of ignorance, I am not ſurprized at its being general. An age that
   produces few marks of genius ought to be ſparing of admiration. The truth is, the bulk of mankind
   have ever been led, by reputation more than taſte, in articles of literature. If all the Romans,
   who admired Virgil, underſtood his beauties, he would have ſcarce deſerved to have come down to
   us, through ſo many centuries. Unleſs genius were in faſhion, Homer himſelf might have written in
   vain. He that wiſhes to come with weight, on the ſuperficial, muſt ſkim the ſurface, in their own

    once, [ ſhall examine the ſubject, without further
   animadverſion on the blunder.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Of</span> all the nations deſcended from the antient <i>Celtæ</i>, the Scots and
   Iriſh are the moſt ſimilar in language, cuſtoms, and manners. This argues a more intimate
   connection between them, than a remote deſcent from the great Celtic ſtock. It is evident, in
   ſhort, that at ſome one period or other, they formed one ſociety, were ſubject to the ſame
   government, and were, in all reſpects, one and the ſame people. How they became divided, which
   the colony, or which the mother nation, I have in another work amply diſcuſſed. The firft
   circumſtance that induced me to diſregard the vulgarly-received opinion of the Hibernian
   extraction of the Scottiſh nation, was my obſervations on their antient language. That dialect of
   the Celtic tongue, ſpoken in the north of Scotland, is much more pure, more agreeable to its
   mother language, and more abounding with primitives, than that now ſpoken, or even that which has
   been written for ſome centuries back, amongſt the moſt unmixed part of the Iriſh nation. A
   Scotchman, tolerably converſant in his own language, underſtands an Iriſh compoſition, from that
   derivative analogy which it has to the <i>Galic</i> of North Britain. An Iriſhman, on the other
   hand, without the aid of ſtudy, can never underſtand

    a compoſition in the Galic tongue. This affords a proof, that the
   Scotch Galic is the moſt original, and, conſequently, the language of a more ancient and unmixed
   people. The Iriſh, however backward they may be to allow any thing to the prejudice of their
   antiquity, ſeem inadvertently to acknowledge it, by the very appellation they give to the dialect
   they ſpeak. They call their own language <i>Caëlic, Eirinach</i>, i. e. <i>Caledonian
   Iriſh</i>, when, on the contrary, they call the dialect of North-Britain <i>a Chaëlic</i>, or
   the <i>Caledonian tongue</i>, emphatically. A circumftance of this nature tends more to decide
   which is the moſt antient nation, than the united teſtimonies of a whole legion of ignorant bards
   and ſenachies, who, perhaps, never dreamed of bringing the Scots from Spain to Ireland, till ſome
   one of them, more learned than the reſt, diſcovered, that the Romans called the firſt
   <i>Iberia</i>, and the latter <i>Hibernia</i>. On ſuch a ſlight foundation were probably
   built the romantic fictions, concerning the Mileſians of Ircland.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">From</span> internal proofs it ſufficiently appears, that the poems publiſhed under
   the name of Oſſian, are not of Iriſh compoſition. The favourite chimæra, that Ireland is the

    of that country, which were forming for ages, and
   growing as they came down, on the hands of ſucceſſive <i>ſenachies</i> and <i>fileas</i>, are
   found, at laſt, to be the ſpurious brood of modern and ignorant ages. To thoſe who know how
   tenacious the Iriſh are, of their pretended <i>Iberian</i> deſcent, this alone is proof
   ſufficient, that poems, ſo ſubverſive of their ſyſtem, could never be produced by an Hibernian
   bard. But when we look to the language, it is ſo different from the Iriſh dialect, that it would
   be as ridiculous to think, that Milton's Paradiſe Loſt could be wrote by a Scottiſh peaſant, as
   to ſuppoſe, that the poems aſcribed to Oſſian were writ in Ireland.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> pretenſions of Ireland to Oſſian proceed from another quarter. There are
   handed down, in that country, traditional poems, concerning the <i>Fiona</i>, or the heroes of
   <i>Fion Mac Comnal</i>. This <i>Fion</i>, ſay the Iriſh annaliſts, was general of the militia
   of Ireland, in the reign of Cormac, in the third century. Where Keating and O'Flaherty learned,
   that Ireland had an <i>embodied</i> militia ſo early, is not eaſy for me to determine. Their
   information certainly did not come from the Iriſh poems,concerning Fion. I have juſt now, in my

    compoſitions; but, unluckily for the antiquities of Ireland, they
   appear to be the work of a very modern period. Every ſtanza, nay almoſt every line, affords
   ſtriking proofs, that they cannot be three centuries old. Their alluſions to the manners and
   cuſtoms of the fifteenth century, are ſo many, that it is matter of wonder to me, how any one
   could dream of their antiquity. They are entirely writ in that romantic taſte, which prevailed
   two ages ago. Giants, enchanted caſtles, dwarfs, palfreys, witches and magicians form the whole
   circle of the poet's invention. The celebrated <i>Fion</i> could ſcarcely move from one hillock

   Witches, on broomſticks, were continually hovering round him, like crows; and he had freed
   enchanted virgins in every valley in Ireland. In ſhort, <i>Fion</i>, great as he was, paſſed a
   diſagreeable life. Not only had he to engage all the miſchiefs in his own country, foreign armies
   invaded him, aſſiſted by magicians and witches, and headed by Kings, as tall as the main-maſt of
   a firſt rate. It muſt be owned, however, that <i>Fion</i> was not inferior to them in height.

    of Fingal in the year 286, yet his ſon Oſſian is made cotemporary
   with St. Patrick, who preached the goſpel in Ireland about the middle of the fifth age. Oſſian,
   though, at that time, he muſt have been two hundred and fifty years of age, had a daughter young
   enough to become wife to the ſaint. On account of this family connection, <i>Patrick of the
   Pſalms</i>, for ſo the apoſtle of Ireland is emphatically called in the poems, took great
   delight in the company of Oſſian, and in hearing the great actions of his family. The ſaint
   ſometimes threw off the aufterity of his profeſſion, drunk freely, and had his ſoul properly
   warmed with wine, to receive with becoming enthuſiaſm, the poems of his father-in-law. One of the
   poems begins with this piece of uſeful information, <span class="quote">

    the <i>Iriſh Oſſian</i> diſcovers the age in which
   he lived, by an unlucky anachroniſm. After deſcribing the total route of Erragon, he very gravely
   concludes with this remarkable anecdote, that none of the foe eſcaped, but a few, who were
   permitted to go on a pilgrimage to the <i>Holy Land</i>. This circumſtance fixes the date of
   the compofition of the piece ſome centuries after the famous croiſade; for, it is evident, that
   the poet thought the time of the croiſade ſo ancient, that he confounds it with the age of
   Fingal. Erragon, in the courſe of this poem, is often called, <span class="quote">

    <i>King of Denmark of two nations</i> </span> which alludes to the union of the
   kingdoms of Norway and Denmark, a circumſtance which happened under Margaret de Waldemar, in the
   cloſe of the fourteenth age. Modern, however, as this pretended Oſſian was, it is certain, he
   lived before the Iriſh had dreamed of appropriating <i>Fion</i>, or <i>Fingal</i>, to
   themſelves. He concludes the poem, with this reflection.<span class="quote">

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> next poem that falls under our obſervation is <i>Cath-cabhra</i>, or,
   <i>The death of Oſcar</i>. This piece is founded on the ſame ſtory which we have in the firft
   book of Temora. So little thought the author of Cath-cabhra of making Oſcar his countryman, that,
   in the courſe of two hundred lines, of which the poems conſiſts, he puts the following expreſſion
   thrice in the mouth of the hero :
  <span class="quote">

  <p class="noindent">The poem contains almoſt all the incidents in the firſt book of Temora. In one circumſtance the

  <p class="noindent">“It is the fleet of my grandfather, coming with aid to our field, from <span class="sc">Albion</span> of many waves !” —The teſtimony of this bard is ſufficient to confute the idle
   fictions of Keating and O'Flaherty ; for, though he is far from being ancient, it is probable, he
   flouriſhed a full century before theſe hiſtorians. He appears, however, to have been a much

   St. Patrick, very devoutly recommends the ſoul of his grandſon to his Redeemer.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><i>Duan a Gharibh Mac-Starn</i> is another Iriſh poem in high repute. The grandeur of its

   of the ſublime to low and indecent deſcription; the laſt of which, the Iriſh tranſlator, no

   ignorance of etymology. <span class="sc">Cu</span>, <i>voice</i>, or commander, ſignifies alſo a
   <i>dog</i>. The poet choſe the laſt, as the moſt noble appellation for his hero.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſubject of the poem is the ſame with that of the epic poem of Fingal.
   <i>Caribh Mac-Starn</i> is the ſame with Oſſian's Swaran, the ſon of Starno. His ſingle combats
   with, and his victory over all the heroes of Ireland, excepting the <i>celebrated dog of
   Tara</i>, i. e. Cuthullin, afford matter for two hundred lines of tolerable poetry.
   <i>Caribh</i>'s progreſs in ſearch of Cuthullin, and his intrigue with the gigantic
   Emir-bragal, that hero's wife, enables the poet to extend his piece to four hundred lines. This
   author, it is true, makes Cuthullin a native of Ireland ; the gigantic Emir-bragal he calls the
   <i>guiding ſtar of the women of Ireland</i>. The property of this enormous lady I ſhall not
   diſpute with him, or any other. But, as he ſpeaks with great tenderneſs of the <i>daughters of
   the convent</i>, and throws out ſome hints againſt the Engliſh nation, it is probable he lived
   in too modern a period to be intimately acquainted with the genealogy of Cuthullin.

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Another</span> Iriſh Oſſian, for there were many, as appears from their difference
   in language and ſentiment, ſpeaks very dogmatically of <i>Fion Mac Comnal</i>, as an Iriſhman.
   Little can be ſaid for the judgment of this poet, and leſs for his delicacy of ſentiment. The
   hiſtory of one of his epiſodes may, at once, ſtand as a ſpecimen of his want of both. Ireland, in
   the days of <i>Fion</i>, happened to be threatened with an invaſion, by three great potentates,
   the kings of Lochlin, Sweden, and France. lt is needleſs to inſiſt upon the impropriety of a
   French invaſion of Ireland ; it is ſufficient for me to be faithful to the language of my author.
   <i>Fion</i>, upon receiving intelligence of the intended invaſion, ſent Ca-olt, Oſſian, and
   Oſcar, to watch the bay, in which, it was apprehended, the enemy was to land. Oſcar was the worſt
   choice of a ſcout that could be made, for, brave as he was, he had the bad property of falling
   very often aſleep on his poſt, nor was it poſſible to awake him, without cutting off one of his
   fingers, or daſhing a large ſtone againſt his head. When the enemy appeared, Oſcar, very
   unfortunately, was aſleep. Oſſian and Ca-olt conſulted about the method of wakening him, and

    little regard to their government. The Scots, in thoſe
   ages, were often in open war, and never in cordial friendſhip with the Engliſh. The ſimilarity of
   manners and language, the traditions concerning their common origin, and above all, their having
   to do with the ſame enemy, created a free and friendly intercourſe between the Scottiſh and Iriſh
   nations. As the cuſtom of retaining bards and ſenachies was common to both ; ſo each, no doubt,
   had formed a ſyſtem of hiſtory, it matters not how much ſoever fabulous, concerning their
   reſpective origin. It was the natural policy of the times, to reconcile the traditions of both
   nations together, and, if poſſible, to reduce them from the ſame original ſtock.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> Saxon manners and language had, at that time, made great progreſs in the
   ſouth of Scotland. The ancient language, and the traditional hiſtory of the nation, became
   confined entirely to the inhabitants of the Highlands, then fallen, from ſeveral concurring
   circumſtances, into the laſt degree of ignorance and barbariſm. The Iriſh, who, for ſome ages
   before the conqueſt, had poſſeſſed a competent ſhare of that kind of learning, which then
   prevailed in Europe, found it no difficult matter to impoſe their own fictions on the ignorant
   Highland ſenachies. By flattering the vanity of the Highlanders, with

   contradiction, aſſumed to themſelves the character of being the mother-nation of the Scots of
   Britain. At this time, certainly, was eſtabliſhed that Hibernian ſyſtem of the original of the
   Scots, which afterwards, for want of any other, was univerſally received. The Scots of the
   low-country, who, by lofing the language of their anceſtors, loſt, together with it, their
   national traditions, received, implicitly, the hiſtory of their country, from Iriſh refugees, or
   from Highland ſenachies, perſuaded over into the Hibernian ſyſtem.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">These</span> circumſtances are far from being ideal. We have remaining many
   particular traditions, which bear teſtimony to a fact, of itſelf abundantly probable. What makes
   the matter inconteſtible is, that the antient traditional accounts of the genuine origin of the
   Scots, have been handed down without interruption. Tho' a few ignorant ſenachies might be
   perſuaded out of their own opinion, by the ſmoothneſs of an Iriſh tale, it was impoſſible to
   eradicate, from among the bulk of the people, their own national traditions. Thefe traditions
   afterwards ſo much prevailed, that the Highlanders continue totally unacquainted with the
   pretended Hibernian extract of the Scots nation. Ignorant chronicle

   are ſcarcely more ſo than the poems of other nations, at that period. On other ſubjects, the
   bards of Ireland have diſplayed a genius for poetry. It was, alone, in matters of antiquity, that
   they were monſtrous in their fables. Their love-ſonnets, and their elegies on the death of
   perſons worthy or renowned, abound with ſimplicity, and a wild harmony of numbers. They become
   more than an atonement for their errors, in every other ſpecies of poetry. But the beauty of
   theſe pieces, depends ſo much on a certain <i>curioſa felicitas</i> of expreſſion in the

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Among</span> the monuments remaining of the ancient ſtate of nations, few are more
   valuable than their poems or ſongs. Hiſtory, when it treats of remote or dark ages, is ſeldom
   very inſtructive. The beginnings of ſociety, in every country, are involved in fabulous
   confuſion; and though they were not, they would furniſh few events worth recording. But, in every
   period of ſociety, human manners are a curious ſpectacle; and the moſt natural pictures of
   ancient manners are exhibited in the ancient poems of nations. Theſe preſent to us what is much
   more valuable than the hiſtory of ſuch tranſactions as a rude age can afford—the hiſtory

They make
   us acquainted with the notions and feelings of our fellow creatures in the moſt artleſs ages;
   Diſcovering what objects they admired, and what pleaſures they purſued, before thoſe refinements
   of ſociety had taken place, which enlarge, indeed, and diverſify the tranſactions, but diſguiſe
   the manners of mankind. </p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Beſides</span> this merit which ancient poems have with philoſophical obſervers of
   human nature, they have another with perſons of taſte. They promiſe ſome of the higheſt beauties
   of poetical writing. Irregular and unpoliſhed we may expect the production of uncultivated ages
   to be; but abounding, at the ſame time, with that enthuſiaſm, that vehemence and fire, which are
   the ſoul of poetry: for many circumſtances of thoſe times which we call barbarous, are favourable
   to the poetical ſpirit. That ſtate, in which human nature ſhoots wild and free, though unfit for

   the ſudden changes of fortune occurring in their unſettled ſtate of life, their paſſions are
   raiſed to the utmoſt; their paſſions have nothing to reſtrain them, their imagination has nothing
   to check it. They diſplay themſelves to one another without diſguiſe, and converſe and act in the
   uncovered ſimplicity of nature. As their feelings are ſtrong, ſo their language, of itſelf,
   aſſumes a poetical turn. Prone to exaggerate, they deſcribe everything in the ſtrongeſt colours;
   which of courſe renders their ſpeech pictureſque and figurative. Figurative language owes its
   riſe chiefly to two cauſes; to the want of proper names for objects, and to the influence of
   imagination and paſſion over the form of expreſſion. Both theſe cauſes concur in the infancy of
   ſociety. Figures are commonly conſidered as artificial modes of ſpeech, deviſed by orators and
   poets, after the world had advanced to a refined ſtate. The contrary of this is the truth. Men
   never have uſed ſo many figures of ſtyle as in thoſe rude ages, when, beſides the power of a warm
   imagination to ſuggeſt lively images, the want of proper and preciſe terms for the ideas they
   would expreſs, obliged them to have recourſe to circumlocution, metaphor, compariſon, and all
   thoſe ſubſtituted forms of expreſſion, which give a poetical air to language.

   more favourable to accuracy than to ſprightlineſs and ſublimity. As the world advances, the

   imagination, leſs. Fewer objects occur that are new or ſurpriſing. Men apply themſelves to trace
   the cauſes of things; they correct and refine one another; they ſubdue or diſguiſe their
   paſſions; they form their exterior manners upon one uniform ſtandard of politeneſs and civility.
   Human nature is pruned according to method and rule. Language advances from ſterility to
   copiouſneſs, and at the ſame time from fervor and enthuſiaſm, to correctneſs and preciſion. Style
   becomes more chaſte, but leſs animated. The progreſs of the world in this reſpect reſembles the
   progreſs of age in man. The powers of imagination are moſt vigorous and predominant in youth;

   of ſociety As the ideas of our youth are remembered with a peculiar pleaſure, on account of their
   livelineſs and vivacity, ſo the moſt ancient poems have often proved the greateſt favourites of
   nations.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Poetry</span> has been ſaid to be more ancient than proſe; and, however paradoxical
   ſuch an aſſertion may ſeem, yet, in a qualified ſenſe, it is true. Men certainly never converſed
   with one another in regular numbers; but even their ordinary language would, in ancient times,
   for the reaſons before aſſigned, approach to a poetical ſtyle; and the firſt compoſitions
   tranſmitted to poſterity, beyond doubt, were, in a literal ſenſe, poems; that is, compoſitions in
   which imagination had the chief hand, formed into ſome kind of numbers, and pronounced with a
   muſical modulation or tone. Muſic or ſong has been found coeval with ſociety among the moſt
   barbarous nations. The only ſubjects which could prompt men, in their firſt rude ſtate, to utter
   their thoughts in compoſitions of any length, were ſuch as naturally aſſumed the tone of poetry;
   praiſes of their gods, or of their anceſtors; commemorations of their own warlike exploits, or
   lamentations over their miſfortunes.

   compoſitions, except ſongs or poems, could take ſuch hold of the imagination and memory, as to be
   preſerved by oral tradition, and handed down from one race to another.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Hence</span> we may expect to find poems among the antiquities of all nations. It
   is probable, too, that an extenſive ſearch would diſcover a certain degree of reſemblance among
   all the moſt ancient poetical productions, from whatever country they have proceeded. In a
   ſimilar ſtate of manners, ſimilar objects and paſſions, operating upon the imaginations of men,
   will ſtamp their productions with the ſame general character. Some diverſity will, no doubt, be
   occaſioned by climate and genius. But mankind never bear ſuch reſembling features as they do in
   the beginnings of ſociety. Its ſubſequent revolutions give riſe to the principal diſtinctions
   among nations; and divert, into channels widely ſeparated, that current of human genius and
   manners which deſcends originally from one ſpring. What we have been long accuſtomed to call the
   oriental vein of poetry, becauſe ſome of the earlieſt poetical productions have come to us from

   curious monument of the true Gothic poetry is preſerved by Olaus Wormius in his book de
   Literatura Runica. It is an epicedium, or funeral ſong, compoſed by Regner Lodbrog, and

   lived in the eighth century, famous for his wars and victories; and at the ſame time an eminent
   <i>ſcalder</i>, or poet. It was his miſfortune to fall at laſt into the hands of one of his
   enemies, by whom he was thrown into priſon, and condemned to he deſtroyed by ſerpents. In this

The crows around the Indirian iſlands
   had an ample prey. It were difficult to ſingle out one among ſo many deaths. At the riſing of the
   ſun I beheld the ſpears piercing the bodies of foes, and the bows throwing forth their
   ſteel-pointed arrows. Loud roared the ſwords in the plains of Lano.—The virgin long bewailed the
   ſlaughter of that morning.”—In this ſtrain the poet continues to deſcribe ſeveral other military
   exploits. The images are not much varied: the noiſe of arms, the ſtreaming of blood, and the
   feaſting the birds of prey often recurring. He mentions the death of two of his ſons in battle;
   and the lamentation he deſcribes as made for one of them is very ſingular. A Grecian or a Roman
   poet would have introduced the virgins or nymphs of the wood bewailing the untimely fall of a
   young hero. But, ſays our Gothic poet, “When Rogvaldus was ſlain, for him mourned all the hawks
   of heaven,” as lamenting a benefactor who had ſo liberally ſupplied them with prey; “for boldly,”
   as he adds, “in the ſtrife of ſwords did the breaker of helmets throw the ſpear of blood.”</p>

   always ready to oppoſe it? He only regrets this life who hath never known diſtreſs. The timorous

   filled their hearts with valor. I am faſt approaching to my end. A cruel death awaits me from the
   viper's bite. A ſnake dwells in the midſt of my heart. I hope that the ſword of ſome of my ſons
   ſhall yet be ſtained with the blood of Ella. The valiant youths will wax red with anger, and will
   not ſit in peace. Fifty and one times have I reared the ſtandard in battle. In my youth I learned
   to dye the ſword in blood: my hope was then that no king among men would be more renowned than
   me. The goddeſſes of death will now ſoon call me; I muſt not mourn my death. Now I end my ſong.
   The goddeſſes invite me away; they whom Odin has ſent to me from his hall. I will ſit upon a

   we learn from ſome of Olauſ's notes, highly metaphorical and figured.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> when we open the works of Oſſian, a very different ſcene preſents
   itſelf. There we find the fire and enthuſiaſm of the moſt early times, combined with an amazing,
   degree of regularity and art. We find tenderneſs, and even delicacy of ſentiment, greatly
   predominant over fierceneſs and barbarity. Our hearts are melted with the ſofteſt feelings, and
   at the ſame time elevated with the higheſt ideas of magnanimity, generoſity, and true heroiſm.
   When we turn from the poetry of Lodbrog to that of Oſſian, it is like paſſing from a ſavage
   deſert into a fertile and cultivated country. How is this to be accounted for? or by what means
   to be reconciled with the remote antiquity attributed to theſe poems? This is a curious point,
   and requires to be illuſtrated.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">That</span> the ancient Scots were of Celtic original, is paſt all doubt. Their

   Celtæ or Gauls are mentioned by ancient writers, we ſeldom fall to hear of their Druids and their
   Bards; the inſtitution of which two orders was the capital diſtinction of their manners and
   policy. The druids were their philoſophers and prieſts; the bards their poets and recorders of

   altogether a groſs and rude nation. They poſſeſſed from very remote ages a formed ſyſtem of
   diſcipline and manners, which appears to have had a deep and laſting influence. Ammianus
   Marcellinus gives them this expreſs teſtimony, that there flouriſhed among them the ſtudy of the
   moſt laudable arts, introduced by the bards, whoſe office it was to ſing in heroic verſe the

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">So</span> ſtrong was the attachment of the Celtic nations to their poetry and
   bards, that, amidſt all the changes of their government and manners, even long after the order of
   the druids was extinct, and the national religion altered, the bards continued to flouriſh; not
   as a ſet of ſtrolling ſongſters, like the Greek Αοιδοι, or Rhapſodiſts, in Homer's time, but as
   an order of men highly reſpected in the ſtate, and ſupported by a public eſtabliſhment. We find
   them, according to the teſtimonies of Strabo and Diodorus, before the age of Auguſtus Cæſar; and
   we find them remaining under the ſame name, and exerciſing the ſame functions as of old, in
   Ireland, and in the north of Scotland, almoſt down to our own times. It is well known, that in
   both theſe countries every <i>Regulus</i> or chief had his own bard, who was conſidered as an
   officer of rank in his court; and had lands aſſigned him, which deſcended to his family. Of the
   honour in which the bards were held, many inſtances occur in Oſſian's Poems. On all important

   failed.'”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">From</span> all this, the Celtic tribes clearly appear to have been addicted in ſo
   high a degree to poetry, and to have made it ſo much their ſtudy from the earlieſt times, as may
   remove our wonder at meeting with a vein of higher poetical refinement among them, than was at
   firſt to have been expected among nations whom we are accuſtomed to call barbarous. Barbarity, I
   muſt obſerve, is a very equivocal term; it admits of many different forms and degrees; and
   though, in all of them, it excludes poliſhed manners, it is, however, not inconſiſtent with
   generous ſentiments and tender affections. <a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333967488"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>

   manners, nearly approaching to the poetical; and in forming even ſuch a hero as Fingal.
   Eſpecially when we conſider, that among their limited objects of ambition, among the few
   advantages which, in a ſavage ſtate, man could obtain over man, the chief was fame, and that
   immortality which they expected to receive from their virtues and exploits, in ſongs of
   bards<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333952496"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Having</span> made theſe remarks on the Celtic poetry and bards in general, I ſhall
   next conſider the particular advantages which Oſſian poſſeſſed. He appears clearly to have lived
   in a period which enjoyed all the benefit I juſt now mentioned of traditionary poetry. The
   exploits of Trathal, Trenmor, and the other anceſtors of Fingal, are ſpoken of as familiarly

In
   one remarkable paſſage Oſſian deſcribes himſelf as living in a ſort of claſſical age, enlightened
   by the memorials of former times, which were conveyed in the ſongs of bards; and points at a
   period of darkneſs and ignorance which lay beyond the reach of tradition. “His words,” ſays he,
   “Came only by halves to our ears; they were dark as the tales of other times, before the light of
   the ſong aroſe.” Oſſian himſelf appears to have been endowed by nature with an exquiſite
   ſenſibility of heart; prone to that tender melancholy which is ſo often an attendant on great
   genius: and ſuſceptible equally of ſtrong and of ſoft emotion. He was not only a profeſſed bard,
   educated with care, as we may eaſily believe, to all the poetical art then known, and connected,
   as he ſhews us himſelf, in intimate friendſhip with the other contemporary bards, but a warrior
   alſo; and the ſon of the moſt renowned hero and prince of his age. This formed a conjunction of
   circumſtances uncommonly favourable towards exalting the imagination of a poet. He relates
   expeditions in which he had been engaged; he ſings of battles in which he had fought and
   overcome; he had beheld the moſt illuſtrious ſcenes which that age could exhibit, both of heroiſm

For however
   rude the magnificence of thoſe times may ſeem to us, we muſt remember, that all ideas of
   magnificence are comparative; and that the age of Fingal was an æra of diſtinguiſhed ſplendor in
   that part of the world. Fingal reigned over a conſiderable territory; he was enriched with the
   ſpoils of the Roman province; he was ennobled by his victories and great actions; and was in all
   reſpects a perſonage of much higher dignity than any of the chieftains, or heads of clans, who
   lived in the ſame country, after a more extenſive monarchy was eſtabliſhed,</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> manners of Oſſian's age, ſo far as we can gather them from his writings,
   were abundantly favourable to a poetical genius. The two diſpiriting vices, to which Longinus
   imputes the decline of poetry, covetouſneſs and effeminacy, were as yet unknown. The cares of men
   were few. They lived a roving indolent life; hunting and war their principal employments; and
   their chief amuſements, the muſic of bards, and the feaſt of ſhells.” The great objects purſued
   by heroic ſpirits, was “to receive their fame;” that is, to become worthy of being celebrated in
   the ſongs of bards; and “to have their name on the four gray ſtones.” To die unlamented by a
   bard, was deemed ſo great a miſfortune as

   ſtate. They wander in thick miſts beſide the reedy lake but never ſhall they riſe, without the
   ſong, to the dwelling of winds.” After death, they expected to follow employments of the ſame
   nature with thoſe which had amuſed them on earth; to fly with their friends on clouds, to purſue
   airy deer, and to liſten to their praiſe in the mouths of bards. In ſuch times as theſe, in a
   country where poetry had been ſo long cultivated, and ſo highly honoured, is it any wonder that,
   among the race and ſucceſſion of bards, one Homer ſhould ariſe: a man, who, endowed with a
   natural happy genius, favoured with peculiar advantages of birth and condition, and meeting, in
   the courſe of his life, with a variety of incidents proper to fire his imagination, and to touch
   his heart, ſhould attain a degree of eminence in poetry, worthy to draw the admiration of more
   refined ages?</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> compoſitions of Oſſian are ſo ſtrongly marked with characters of
   antiquity, that although there were no external proof to ſupport that antiquity, hardly any
   reader of judgment and taſte could heſitate in referring them to a very remote æra. There are
   four great ſtages through which men ſucceſſively paſs in the progreſs of ſociety. The firſt and

   this, as the ideas of property begin to take root; next agriculture; and, laſtly, commerce.
   Throughout Oſſian's Poems we plainly find ourſelves in the firſt of theſe periods of ſociety;
   during which hunting was the chief employment of men, and the principal method of their procuring
   ſubſiſtence. Paſturage was not indeed wholly unknown; for we hear of dividing the herd in the
   caſe of a divorce; but the alluſions to herds and to cattle are not many; and of agriculture we
   find no traces. No cities appear to have been built in the territories of Fingal. No arts are
   mentioned, except that of navigation and of working in iron<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333935072"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>. Every thing preſents to

At
   their feaſts, the heroes prepared their own repaſt; they ſat round the light of the burning oak;
   the wind lifted their locks, and whiſtled through their open halls. Whatever was beyond the
   neceſſaries of life was known to them only as the ſpoil of the Roman province; “the gold of the
   ſtranger; the lights of the ſtranger; the ſteeds of the ſtranger; the children of the rein.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">This</span> repreſentation of Oſſian's times muſt ſtrike us the more, as genuine
   and authentick, when it is compared with a poem of later date, which Mr. Macpherſon has preſerved
   in one of his notes. It is that in which five bards are repreſented as paſſing the evening in the
   houſe of a chief, and each of them ſeparately giving his deſcription of the night. The night
   ſcenery is beautiful; and the author has plainly imitated the ſtyle and manner of Oſſian; but he
   has allowed ſome images to appear which betray a later period of ſociety. For we meet with

   ſeeking ſhelter, the ſhepherd wandering, corn on the plain, and the wakeful hind rebuilding the
   ſhocks of corn which had been overturned by the tempeſt. Whereas, in Oſſian's works, from
   beginning to end, all is conſiſtent; no modern alluſion drops from him; but everywhere the ſame
   face of rude nature appears; a country wholly uncultivated, thinly inhabited, and recently
   peopled. The graſs of the rock, the flower of the heath, the thiſtle with its beard, are the
   chief ornaments of his landſcapes. “The deſert,” ſays Fingal, “is enough for me, with all its
   woods and deer.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> circle of ideas and tranſactions is no wider than ſuits ſuch an age; nor
   any greater diverſity introduced into characters, than the events of that period would naturally
   diſplay. Valor and bodily ſtrength are the admired qualities. Contentions ariſe, as is uſual
   among ſavage nations, from the ſlighteſt cauſes. To be affronted at a tournament, or to be
   omitted in the invitation to a feaſt, kindles a war. Women are often carried away by force; and
   the whole tribe, as in the Homeric times, riſe to avenge the wrong. The heroes ſhow refinement of

   exploits, and ſing their own praiſe. In their battles, it is evident, that drums, trumpets, or
   bagpipes, were not known or uſed. They had no expedient for giving the military alarms but
   ſtriking a ſhield, or raiſing a loud cry: and hence the loud and terrible voice of Fingal is
   often mentioned as a neceſſary qualification of a great general; like the <i>βοην αγαθος Μενελαος</i> of Homer. Of military diſcipline or ſkill they appear to have
   been entirely deſtitute. Their armies ſeem not to have been numerous; their battles were
   diſorderly; and terminated, for the moſt part, by a perſonal combat, or wreſtling of the two
   chiefs; after which, “the bard ſung the ſong of peace, and the battle ceaſed along the
   field.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> manner of compoſition bears all the marks of the greateſt antiquity. No
   artful tranſitions, nor full and extended connexion of parts; ſuch as we find among the poets of
   later times, when order and regularity of compoſition were more ſtudied and known: but a ſtyle
   always rapid and vehement; narration conciſe, even to abruptneſs, and leaving ſeveral

   ſterility of language and the want of proper terms, have always introduced into the early ſpeech
   of nations; and in ſeveral reſpects, it carries a remarkable reſemblance to the ſtyle of the Old
   Teſtament. It deſerves particular notice, as one of the moſt genuine and deciſive characters of
   antiquity, that very few general terms, or abſtract ideas, are to be met with in the whole
   collection of Oſſian's works. The ideas of men, at firſt, were all particular. They had not words
   to expreſs general conceptions. Theſe were the conſequences of more profound reflection, and
   longer acquaintance with the arts of thought and of ſpeech. Oſſian, accordingly, almoſt never
   expreſſes himſelf in the abſtract. His ideas extended little further than to the objects he ſaw
   around him. A public, a community, the univerſe, were conceptions beyond his ſphere. Even a
   mountain, a ſea, or a lake, which he has occaſion to mention, though only in a ſimile, are for
   the moſt part particularized; it is the hill of Cromla, the ſtorm of the ſea of Malmor, or the
   reeds of the lake of Lego. A mode of expreſſion which, while it is characteriſtical of ancient
   ages, is at the ſame time highly favourable to deſcriptive poetry. For the ſame reaſons,
   perſonification is a poetical figure not

Inanimate objects,
   ſuch as winds, trees, flowers, he ſometimes perſonifies with great beauty. But the
   perſonifications which are ſo familiar to later poets, of Fame, Time, Terror, Virtue, and the
   reſt of that claſs, were unknown to our Celtic bard. Theſe were modes of conception too abſtract
   for his age.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">All</span> theſe are marks ſo undoubted, and ſome of them, too ſo nice and
   delicate, of the moſt early times, as put the high antiquity of theſe poems out of queſtion.
   Eſpecially when we conſider, that if there had been any impoſture in this caſe, it muſt have been
   contrived and executed in the Highlands of Scotland, two or three centuries ago; as up to this
   period, both by manuſcripts, and by the teſtimony of a multitude of living witneſſes, concerning
   the uncontrovertible tradition of theſe poems, they can clearly be traced. Now, this is a period
   when that country enjoyed no advantages for a compoſition of this kind, which it may not be
   ſuppoſed to have enjoyed in as great, if not in a greater degree, a thouſand years before. To
   ſuppoſe that two or three hundred years ago, when we well know the Highlands to have been in a

   knowledge of mankind, and of hiſtory, as to diveſt himſelf of the ideas and manners of his own
   age, and to give us a juſt and natural picture of a ſtate of ſociety ancienter by a thouſand
   years; one who could ſupport this counterfeited antiquity through ſuch a large collection of
   poems, without the leaſt inconſiſtency; and who, poſſeſſed of all this genius and art, had, at
   the ſame time, the ſelf-denial of concealing himſelf, and of aſcribing his own works to an
   antiquated bard, without the impoſture being detected; is a ſuppoſition that tranſcends all
   bounds of credibility.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">There</span> are, beſides, two other circumſtances to be attended to, ſtill of
   greater weight, if poſſible, againſt this hypotheſis. One is, the total abſence of religious
   ideas from this work; for which the tranſlator has, in his preface, given a very probable
   account, on the footing of its being the work of Oſſian. The druidical ſuperſtition was, in the
   days of Oſſian, on the point of its final extinction; and, for particular reaſons, odious to the
   family of Fingal; whilſt the Chriſtian faith was not yet eſtabliſhed. But had it been the work of
   one to whom the ideas of Chriſtianity were familiar from his infancy, and who had ſuperadded to
   them alſo the

   country, it is impoſſible. but in ſome paſſage or other, the traces of them would have appeared.
   The other circumſtance is, the entire ſilence which reigns with reſpect to all the great clans or
   families which are now eſtabliſhed in the Highlands. The origin of theſe ſeveral clans is known
   to be very ancient; and it is well known that there is no paſſion by which a native Highlander is
   more diſtinguiſhed than by attachment to his clan, and jealouſy for its honour. That a Highland
   bard, in forging a work relating to the antiquities of his country, ſhould have inſerted no
   circumſtance which pointed out the riſe of his own clan, which aſcertained its antiquity, or
   increaſed its glory, is, of all ſuppoſitions that can be formed, the moſt improbable; and the
   ſilence on this head amounts to a demonſtration that the author lived before any of the preſent
   great clans were formed or known.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Aſſuming</span> it then, as well we may, for certainty, that the poems, now under
   conſideration, are genuine venerable monuments of a very remote antiquity, I proceed to make ſome
   remarks upon their general ſpirit and ſtrain. The two great characteriſtics of Oſſian's poetry
   are, tenderneſs and ſublimity. It breathes nothing of the gay and cheerful kind; an air of
   ſolemnity
   <span class="page-number-image-wrapper"><span class="page-break">

   Oſſian is, perhaps, the only poet who never relaxes, or lets himſelf down into the light and
   amuſing ſtrain which I readily admit to be no ſmall diſadvantage to him, with the bulk of
   readers. He moves perpetually in the high region of the grand and the pathetic. One keynote is
   ſtruck at the beginning, and ſupported to the end; nor is any ornament introduced, but what is
   perfectly concordant with the general tone of melody. The events recorded, are all ſerious and
   grave; the ſcenery throughout, wild and romantic. The extended heath by the ſeaſhore; the
   mountains ſhaded with miſt; the torrent ruſhing through a ſolitary valley; the ſcattered oaks,
   and the tombs of warriors overgrown with moſs; all produce a ſolemn attention in the mind, and
   prepare it for great and extraordinary events. We find not in Oſſian an imagination that ſports
   itſelf, and dreſſes out gay trifles to pleaſe the fancy. His poetry, more perhaps than that of
   any other writer, deſerves to be ſtiled, <i>The poetry of the heart</i>. It is a heart
   penetrated with noble ſentiments and with ſublime and tender paſſions; a heart that glows, and
   kindles the fancy; a heart that is full, and pours itſelf forth. Oſſian did not write,, like
   modern poets, to pleaſe readers and critics. He ſung from the

His delight was to
   think of the heroes among whom he had flouriſhed; to recall the affecting incidents of his life;
   to dwell upon his paſt wars, and loves, and friendſhips: till, as he expreſſes it himſelf, “there
   comes a voice to Oſſian, and awakes his ſoul. It is the voice of years that are gone; they roll
   before me with all their deeds;” and under this true poetic inſpiration, giving vent to his
   genius, no wonder we ſhould ſo often hear, and acknowledge, in his ſtrains, the powerful and

   much crowned with imagery; the mind is kept at ſuch a ſtretch in accompanying the author; that an

Thoſe who have the higheſt

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">As</span> Homer is, of all the great poets, the one whoſe manner, and whoſe times,
   come the neareſt to Oſſian's, we are naturally led to run a parallel in ſome inſtances between
   the Greek and Celtic bard. For though Homer lived more than a thouſand years before Oſſian, it is
   not from the age of the world, but from the ſtate of ſociety that we are to judge of reſembling
   times. The Greek has, in ſeveral points, a manifeſt ſuperiority. He introduces a greater variety
   of incidents; he poſſeſſes a larger compaſs of ideas; has more diverſity in his characters; and a
   much deeper knowledge of human nature. It was not to be expected, that in any of theſe
   particulars Oſſian could equal Homer. For Homer lived in a country where ſociety was much farther
   advanced; he had beheld many more objects; cities built and flouriſhing; laws inſtituted; order,
   diſcipline, and arts, begun. His field of obſervation was much larger and more ſplendid: his
   knowledge, of courſe, more extenſive; his mind alſo, it ſhall be granted, more penetrating. But
   if Oſſian's ideas and objects be leſs diverſified than thoſe of Homer, they are all, however, of
   the kind fitteſt for poetry: the bravery and generoſity of heroes, the tenderneſs of lovers,

   children. In a rude age and country, though the events that happen be few, the undiſſipated mind
   broods over them more; they ſtrike the imagination, and fire the paſſions, in a higher degree;
   and, of conſequence, become happier materials to a poetical genius, than the ſame events when
   ſcattered through the wide circle of more varied action and cultivated life.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Homer</span> is a more cheerful and ſprightly poet than Oſſian. You diſcern in him
   all the Greek vivacity; whereas Oſſian uniformly maintains the gravity and ſolemnity of a Celtic
   hero. This, too, is in a great meaſure to be accounted for from the different ſituations in which
   they lived—partly perſonal, and partly national. Oſſian had ſurvived all his friends, and was
   diſpoſed to melancholy by the incidents of his life. But, beſides this, cheerfulneſs is one of
   the many bleſſings which we owe to formed ſociety. The ſolitary, wild ſtate, is always a ſerious
   one. Bating the ſudden and violent burſts of mirth, which ſometimes break forth at their dances
   and feaſts, the ſavage American tribes have been noted by all travellers for their gravity and
   taciturnity. Somewhat of this taciturnity may be alſo be remarked in Oſſian. On all occaſions he
   is frugal of his words; and never gives you more of an

   ſufficient to place it before you in one clear point of view. It is a blaze of lightning, which
   flaſhes and vaniſhes. Homer is more extended in his deſcriptions, and fills them up with a
   greater variety of circumſtances. Both the poets are dramatic; that is, they introduce their
   perſonages frequently ſpeaking before us. But Oſſian is conciſe and rapid in his ſpeeches, as he
   is in every other thing. Homer, with the Greek vivacity, had alſo ſome portion of the Greek
   loquacity. His ſpeeches, indeed, are highly characteriſtical; and to them we are much indebted
   for that admirable diſplay he has given of human nature. Yet, if he be tedious any where, it is
   in theſe: ſome of them are trifling, and ſome of them plainly unſeaſonable. Both poets are
   eminently ſublime; but a difference may be remarked in the ſpecies of their ſublimity. Homer's
   ſublimity is accompanied with more impetuoſity and fire; Oſſian's with more of a ſolemn and awful
   grandeur. Homer hurries you along; Oſſian elevates, and fixes you in aſtoniſhment. Homer is moſt
   ſublime in actions and battles; Oſſian in deſcription and ſentiment. In the pathetic, Homer, when
   he chooſes to exert it, has great power; but Oſſian exerts that power much oftener, and has the
   character of tenderneſs far

No poet
   knew better how to ſeize and melt the heart. With regard to dignity of ſentiment, the
   pre-eminence muſt clearly he given to Oſſian. This is, indeed, a ſurpriſing circumſtance, that in
   point of humanity, magnanimity, virtuous feelings of every kind, our rude Celtic bard ſhould be
   diſtinguiſhed to ſuch a degree, that not only the heroes of Homer, but even thoſe of the polite
   and refined Virgil, are left far behind by thoſe of Oſſian.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">After</span> theſe general obſervations on the genius and ſpirit of our author, I
   now proceed to a nearer view and more accurate examination of his works; and as Fingal is the
   firſt great poem in this collection, it is proper to begin with it. To refuſe the title of an
   epic poem to Fingal, becauſe it is not, in every little particular, exactly conformable to the
   practice of Homer and Virgil, were the mere ſqueamiſhneſs and pedantry of criticiſm. Examined
   even according to Ariſtotle's rules, it will be found to have all the eſſential requiſites of a
   true and regular epic; and to have ſeveral of them in ſo high a degree, as at firſt view to raiſe
   our aſtoniſhment on finding Oſſian's compoſition ſo agreeable to rules of which he was entirely
   ignorant. But our aſtoniſhment will ceaſe, when we conſider

   Homer knew no more of the laws of criticiſm than Oſſian. But, guided by nature, he compoſed in
   verſe a regular ſtory, founded on heroic actions, which all poſterity admired. Ariſtotle, with
   great ſagacity and penetration, traced the cauſes of this general admiration. He obſerved what it
   was in Homer's compoſition, and in the conduct of his ſtory, which gave it ſuch power to pleaſe;
   from. this obſervation he deduced the rules which poets ought to follow, who would write and
   pleaſe like Homer; and to a compoſition formed according to ſuch rules, he gave the name of an
   epic poem. Hence his whole ſyſtem aroſe. Ariſtotle ſtudied nature in Homer. Homer and Oſſian both
   wrote from nature. No wonder that among all the three, there ſhould be ſuch agreement and
   conformity.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> fundamental rules delivered by Ariſtotle concerning an epic poem, are
   theſe: that the action, which is the groundwork of the poem, ſhould be one, complete, and great;
   that it ſhould be feigned, not merely hiſtorical; that it ſhould be enlivened with characters and
   manners, and heightened by the marvellous.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span>, before entering on any of theſe, it may perhaps be aſked, what is the
   moral of Fingal? For, according to M. Boſſu, an epic poem is
   <span class="page-number-image-wrapper"><span class="page-break">
                [

   illuſtrate ſome, moral truth. The poet, ſays this critic, muſt begin with fixing on ſome maxim or
   inſtruction, which he intends to inculcate on mankind. He next forms a fable, like one of Æſop's,
   wholly with a view to the moral; and having thus ſettled and arranged his plan, he then looks
   into traditionary hiſtory for names and incidents, to give his fable ſome air of probability.
   Never did a more frigid, pedantic notion enter into the mind of a critic. We may ſafely
   pronounce, that he who ſhould compoſe an epic poem after this manner, who ſhould firſt lay down a
   moral and contrive a plan, before he had thought of his perſonages and actors, might deliver,
   indeed, very ſound inſtruction, but would find very few readers. There cannot be the leaſt doubt
   that the firſt object which ſtrikes an epic poet, which fires his genius, and gives him any idea
   of his work, is the action or ſubject he is to celebrate. Hardly is there any tale, any ſubject,
   a poet can chooſe for ſuch a work, but will afford ſome general moral inſtruction. An epic poem
   is, by its nature, one of the moſt moral of all poetical compoſitions: but its moral tendency is
   by no means to be limited to ſome commonplace maxim, which may be gathered from the ſtory. It
   ariſes from the admiration of heroic actions,

   calculated to produce; from the virtuous emotions which the characters and incidents raiſe,
   whilſt we read it; from the happy impreſſions which all the parts ſeparately, as well as the
   whole together, leave upon the mind. However, if a general moral be ſtill inſiſted on, Fingal
   obviouſly furniſhes one, not inferior to that of any other poet, viz: that wiſdom and bravery
   always triumph over brutal force: or another, nobler ſtill: that the moſt complete victory over
   an enemy is obtained by that moderation and generoſity which convert him into a friend.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> unity of the epic action, which of all Ariſtotle's rules, is the chief
   and moſt material, is ſo ſtrictly preſerved in Fingal, that it muſt be perceived by every reader.
   It is a more complete unity than what ariſes from relating the actions of one man, which the
   Greek critic juſtly cenſures as imperfect: it is the unity of one enterpriſe—the deliverance of
   Ireland from the invaſion of Swaran; an enterpriſe which has ſurely the full heroic dignity. All
   the incidents recorded bear a conſtant reference to one end; no double plot is carried on; but
   the pa unite into a regular whole; and as the action is one and great, ſo it is an entire or
   complete action. For we find, as the critic, farther

   a nodus, or intrigue, in the poem; difficulties occurring through Cuthullin's raſhneſs and bad
   ſucceſs; thoſe difficulties gradually ſurmounted; and at laſt, the work conducted to that happy
   concluſion which is held eſſential to epic poetry. Unity is, indeed, obſerved with greater
   exactneſs in Fingal, than in almoſt any other epic compoſition. For not only is unity of ſubject
   maintained, but that of time and place alſo. The autumn is clearly pointed out as the ſeaſon of
   the action; and from beginning to end the ſcene is never ſhifted from the heath of Lena, along
   the ſeaſhore. The duration of the action in Fingal, is much ſhorter than in the Iliad or Æneid;
   but ſure there may be ſhorter as well longer heroic poems; and if the authority of Ariſtotle be
   alſo required for this, he ſays expreſſly, that the epic compoſition is indefinite as to the time
   of its duration. Accordingly, the action of the Iliad laſts only forty-ſeven days, whilſt that of
   the Æneid is continued for more than a year.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Throughout</span> the whole of Fingal, there reigns that grandeur of ſentiment,
   ſtyle, and imagery, which ought ever to diſtinguiſh this high ſpecies of poetry. The ſtory is

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">He</span> invokes no muſe, for he acknowledged none. but his occaſional addreſſes
   to Malvina have a finer effect than the invocation of any muſe. He ſets out with no formal
   propoſition of his ſubject; but the ſubject naturally and eaſily unfolds itſelf; the poem opening
   in an animated manner, with the ſituation of Cuthullin, and the arrival of a ſcout, who informs
   him of Swaran's landing. Mention is preſently made of Fingal, and of the expected aſſiſtance from
   the ſhips of the lonely iſle, in order to give farther light to the ſubject. For the poet often
   ſhews his addreſs in gradually preparing us for the events he is to introduce; and, in
   particular, the preparation for the appearance of Fingal, the previous expectations that are

   poet of the moſt refined times. Homer's art in magnifying the character of Achilles, has been
   univerſally admired. Oſſian certainly ſhews no leſs aft in aggrandizing Fingal. Nothing could be
   more happily imagined for this purpoſe than the whole management of the laſt battle, wherein
   Gaul, the ſon of Morni, had beſought Fingal to retire, and to leave him and his other chiefs the
   honour of the day. The generoſity of the king in agreeing to this propoſal; the majeſty with
   which he retreats to the hill, from whence he was to behold the engagement, attended by his
   bards, and waving the lightning of his ſword; his perceiving the chiefs overpowered by numbers,
   but, from unwillingneſs to deprive them of the glory of victory by coming in perſon to their
   aſſiſtance, firſt ſending Ullin, the bard, to animate their courage, and at laſt, when the danger
   becomes more preſſing, his riſing in his might, and interpoſing, like a divinity, to decide the
   doubtful fate of the day; are all circumſtances contrived with ſo much art, as plainly diſcover
   the Celtic bards to have been not unpractiſed in heroic poetry.</p>

   concerning a female ſlave; on which Achilles, apprehending himſelf to be injured, withdraws his
   aſſiſtance from the reſt of the Greeks. The Greeks fall into great diſtreſs, and beſeech him to
   be reconciled to them. He refuſes to fight for them in perſon, but ſends his friend Patroclus;
   and upon his being ſlain, goes forth to revenge his death, and kills Hector. The ſubject of
   Fingal is this: Swaran comes to invade Ireland; Cuthullin, the guardian of the young king, had
   applied for his aſſiſtance to Fingal, who reigned in the oppoſite coaſt of Scotland. But before
   Fingal's arrival, he is hurried by raſh counſel to encounter Swaran. He is defeated; he retreats,
   and deſponds. Fingal arrives in this conjuncture. The battle is for ſome time dubious; but in the
   end he conquers Swaran; and the remembrance of Swaran's being the brother of Agandecca, who, had
   once ſaved his life, makes him diſmiſs him honourably. Homer, it is true, has filled up his ſtory
   with a much greater variety of particulars than Oſſian; and in this has ſhown a compaſs of
   invention ſuperior to that of the other poet. But it muſt not be forgotten that though Homer be
   more circumſtantial, his incidents, however, are leſs diverſified in kind than thoſe of Oſſian.

   notwithſtanding all the fertility of Homer's invention, there is ſo much uniformity in his
   ſubjects, that there are few readers, who, before the cloſe, are not tired with perpetual
   fighting. Whereas in Oſſian, the mind is relieved by a more agreeable diverſity. There is a finer
   mixture of war and heroiſm, with love and friendſhip—of martial, with tender ſcones, than is to
   be met with, perhaps, in any other poet. The epiſodes, too, have great propriety—as natural, and
   proper to that age and country: conſiſting of the ſongs of bards, which are known to have been
   the great entertainment of the Celtic heroes in war, as well as in peace. Theſe ſongs are not
   introduced at random; if you except the epiſode of Duchommar and Morna, in the firſt book, which,
   though beautiful, is more unartful than any of the reſt, they have always ſome particular
   relation to the actor who is intereſted, or to the events which are going on; and, whilſt they
   vary the ſcene, they preſerve a ſufficient connection with the main ſubject by the fitneſs and
   propriety of their introduction.</p>

But as it lay
   without the compaſs of the preſent action, it could be regularly introduced nowhere except in an
   epiſode. Accordingly, the poet, with as much propriety as if Ariſtotle himſelf had directed the
   plan, has contrived an epiſode for this purpoſe in the ſong of Carril, at the beginning of the
   third book.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> concluſion of the poem is ſtrictly according to rule, and is every way
   noble and pleaſing. Th reconciliation of the contending heroes, the conſolation of Cuthullin, and
   the general felicity that crowns the action, ſoothe the mind in a very agreeable manner, and form
   that paſſage from agitation and trouble, to perfect quiet and repoſe, which critics require as
   the proper termination of the epic work. “Thus they paſſed the night in ſong, and brought back
   the morning with joy. Fingal aroſe on the heath; and ſhook his glittering ſpear in his hand. He
   moved firſt towards the plains of Lena; and we followed like a ridge of fire. Spread the ſail,
   ſaid the king of Morven, and catch the winds that pour from Lena. We roſe on the waves with
   ſongs; and ruſhed with joy through the foam of the ocean.” So much for the unity and general
   conduct of the Epic action in Fingal.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">With</span> regard to that property of the ſubject which Ariſtotle requires, that
   it ſhould be feigned, not hiſtorical, he muſt not be underſtood ſo ſtrictly is if he meant to
   exclude all ſubjects which have any foundation in truth. For ſuch excluſion would both be
   unreaſonable in itſelf, and what is more, would be contrary to the practice of Homer, who is
   known to have founded his Iliad on hiſtorical facts concerning the war of Troy, which was famous
   throughout all Greece. Ariſtotle means no more than that it is the buſineſs of a poet not to be a
   more annaliſt of facts, but to embelliſh truth with beautiful, probable, and uſeful fictions; to
   copy nature as he himſelf explains it, like painters, who preſerve a likeneſs, but exhibit their
   objects more grand and beautiful than they are in reality. That Oſſian has followed this courſe,
   and building upon true hiſtory, has ſufficiently adorned it with poetical fiction for
   aggrandizing his characters and facts, will not, I believe, be queſtioned by moſt readers. At the
   ſame time, the foundation which thoſe facts and characters had in truth, and the ſhare which the
   poet had himſelf in the tranſactions which he records, muſt be conſidered as no ſmall advantage

   events ſo feelingly as thoſe in which he has been intereſted; paints any ſcene ſo naturally as
   one which he has ſeen; or draws any characters in ſuch ſtrong colours as thoſe which he has
   perſonally known. It is conſidered as an advantage of the epic ſubject to be taken from a period
   ſo diſtant, as, by being involved in the darkneſs of tradition, may give licenſe to fable. Though
   Oſſian's ſubject may at firſt view appear unfavourable in this reſpect, as being taken from his
   own times, yet, when we reflect that he lived to an extreme old age; that he relates what had
   been tranſacted in another country, at the diſtance of many years, and after all that race of men
   who had been the actors were gone off the ſtage; we ſhall find the objection in a great meaſure
   obviated. In ſo rude an age, when no written records were known, when tradition was looſe, and
   accuracy of any kind little attended to, what was great and heroic in one generation, eaſily
   ripened into the marvellous in the next.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> natural repreſentation of human character in an epic poem is highly
   eſſential to its merit; and, in reſpect of this, there can be no doubt of Homer's excelling all

   ſuperior to Virgil; and has, indeed, given all the diſplay of human nature, which the ſimple
   occurrences of his times could be expected to furniſh. No dead uniformity of character prevails
   in Fingal; but, on the contrary, the principal characters are not only clearly diſtinguiſhed, but
   ſometimes artfully contraſted, ſo as to illuſtrate each other. Oſſian's heroes are like Homer's,
   all brave; but their bravery, like thoſe of Homer's too, is of different kinds. For inſtance: the
   prudent, the ſedate, the modeſt and circumſpect Connal, is finely oppoſed to the preſumptuous,
   raſh, overbearing, but gallant and generous Calmar. Calmar hurries Cuthullin into action by his
   temerity; and when he ſees the bad effects of his counſels, he will not ſurvive the diſgrace.
   Connal, like another Ulyſſes, attends Cuthullin to his retreat, counſels and comforts him under
   his miſfortune. The fierce, the proud, and the high-ſpirited Swaran, is admirably contraſted with
   the calm, the moderate, and generous Fingal. The character of Oſcar is a favourite one throughout
   the whole poems. The amiable warmth of the young warrior; his eager impetuoſity in the day of
   action; his paſſion for fame; his ſubmiſſion to his father; his tenderneſs for Malvina; are the
   ſtrokes of a maſterly

   hand of nature, and attracts the heart. Oſſian's own character, the old man, the hero, and the
   bard, all in one, preſents to us, through the whole work, a moſt reſpectable and venerable
   figure, which we always contemplate with pleaſure. Cuthullin is a hero of the higheſt claſs:
   daring, magnanimous, and exquiſitely ſenſible to honour. We become attached to his intereſt, and
   are deeply touched with his diſtreſs; and after the admiration raiſed for him in the firſt part
   of the poem, it is a ſtrong proof of Oſſian's maſterly genius, that he durſt adventure to produce
   to us another hero, compared with whom, even the great Cuthullin ſhould be only an inferior
   perſonage; and who ſhould riſe as far above him, as Cuthullin riſes above the reſt.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Here</span> indeed, in the character and deſcription of Fingal, Oſſian triumphs
   almoſt unrivalled; for we may boldly defy all antiquity to ſhow us any hero equal to Fingal.
   Homer's Hector poſſeſſes ſeveral great and amiable qualities; but Hector is a ſecondary perſonage
   in the Iliad, not the hero of the work. We ſee him only occaſionally; we know much leſs of him
   than we do of Fingal; who, not only in this, epic poem, but in Temora, and throughout the reſt of
   Oſſian's works, is preſented in all that variety of

   character. And though Hector faithfully diſcharges his duty to his country, his friends, and his
   family, he is tinctured, however, with a degree of the ſame ſavage ferocity which prevails among
   all the Homeric heroes: for we find him inſulting over the fallen Patroclus with the moſt cruel
   taunts, and telling him, when he lies in the agonies of death, that Achilles cannot help him now;
   and that in a ſhort time his body, ſtripped naked, and deprived of funeral honours, ſhall be
   devoured by the vultures<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333821024"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>. Whereas, in the character of Fingal, concur almoſt
   all the qualities that can ennoble human nature; that can either make us admire the hero, or love
   the man. He is not only unconquerable in war, but he makes his people happy by his wiſdom in the
   days of peace. He is truly too father of his people. He is known by the epithet or “Fingal of the
   mildeſt look;” and diſtinguiſhed on every occaſion by humanity and generoſity. He is merciful to

   friends; and never mentions Agandecca, his firſt love, without the utmoſt tenderneſs. He is the
   univerſal Protector of the diſtreſſed; “None ever went ſad from Fingal.”—“O, Oſcar! bend the
   ſtrong in arms; but ſpare the feeble hand. Be thou a ſtream of mighty tides againſt the foes of
   thy people; but like the gale that moves the graſs to thoſe who aſk thine aid. So Trenmor lived;
   ſuch Trathal was; and ſuch has Fingal been. My arm was the ſupport of the injured; the weak
   reſted behind the lightning of my ſteel.” Theſe were the maxims of true heroiſm, to which he
   formed his grandſon. His fame is repreſented as everywhere ſpread; the greateſt heroes
   acknowledge his ſuperiority; his enemies tremble at his name; and the higheſt encomium that can
   be beſtowed on one whom the poets would moſt exalt, is to ſay, that his ſoul was like the ſoul of
   Fingal.</p>

   difficult, than to draw a perfect character in ſuch a manner as to render it diſtinct, and
   affecting to the mind. Some ſtrokes of human imperfection and frailty, are what uſually give us
   the moſt clear view, and the moſt ſenſible impreſſion of a character; becauſe they preſent to us
   a man, ſuch as we have ſeen; they recall known features of human nature. When poets attempt to go
   beyond this range, and deſcribe a faultleſs hero, they for the moſt part ſet before us a ſort of
   vague, undiſtinguiſhable character, ſuch as the imagination cannot lay hold of, or realize to
   itſelf as the object of affection. We know how much Virgil has failed in this particular. His
   perfect hero, Æneas, is an unanimated, inſipid perſonage, whom we may pretend to admire, but whom
   no one can heartily love. But what Virgil has failed in, Oſſian, to our aſtoniſhment, has
   ſucceſſfully executed. His Fingal, though exhibited without any of the common human failings, is,
   nevertheleſs, a real man; a character which touches and intereſts every reader. To this it has
   much contributed that the poet has repreſented him as an old man; and by this has gained the
   advantage of throwing around him a great many circumſtances, peculiar to that age, which paint
   him to the fancy in a more diſtinct

He is ſurrounded with his family; he
   inſtructs his children in the principles of virtue; he is narrative of his paſt exploits he is
   venerable with the gray locks of age; he is frequently diſpoſed to moralize, like an old man, on
   human vanity, and the proſpect of death. There is more art, at leaſt more felicity, in this, than
   may at firſt be imagined. For youth and old are the two ſtates of human life, capable of being
   placed in the moſt pictureſque lights. Middle age is more general and vague; and has fewer
   circumſtances peculiar to the idea of it. And when any object is in a ſituation that admits it to
   be rendered particular, and to be clothed with a variety of circumſtances, it always ſtands out
   more clear and full of poetical deſcription.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Beſides</span> human perſonages, divine or ſupernatural agents are often introduced
   into epic poetry, forming what is called the machinery of it; which moſt critics hold to be an
   eſſential part. The marvellous, it muſt he admitted, has always a great charm for the bulk of
   readers. It gratifies the imagination, and affords room for ſtriking and ſublime deſcription. No
   wonder, therefore, that all poets ſhould have a ſtrong propenſity towards it. But I muſt obſerve,
   that nothing is more difficult than to adjuſt properly the marvellous with the probable. If a

   with extravagant ſupernatural ſcenes, he ſpreads over it an appearance of romance and childiſh
   fiction; he tranſports his readers from this world into a fantaſtic viſionary region; and loſes
   that weight and dignity which ſhould reign in epic poetry. No work from which probability is
   altogether baniſhed, can make a laſting or deep impreſſion. Human actions and manners are always,
   the moſt intereſting objects which can be preſented to a human mind. All machinery, therefore, is
   faulty, which withdraws theſe too much from view, or obſcures them under a cloud of incredible
   fictions. Beſides being temperately employed, machinery ought always to have ſome foundation in
   popular belief. A poet is by no means at liberty to invent what ſyſtem of the marvellous he
   pleaſes; he muſt avail himſelf either of the religious faith, or the ſuperſtitious credulity of
   the country wherein he lives; ſo as to give an air of probability to events which are moſt
   contrary to the common courſe of nature.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> theſe reſpects, Oſſian appears to me to have been remarkably happy. He
   has, indeed, followed the ſame courſe with Homer. For it is perfectly abſurd to imagine, as ſome
   critics have done, that Homer's mythology was invented by

   on the benefits it would yield to poetry.” Homer was no ſuch refining genius. He found the
   traditionary ſtories, on which he built his Iliad, mingled with popular legends concerning the
   intervention of the gods; and he adopted theſe becauſe they amuſed the fancy. Oſſian, in like
   manner, found the tales of his country full of ghoſts and ſpirits; it is likely he believed them
   himſelf; and he introduced them, becauſe they gave his poems that ſolemn and marvellous caſt
   which ſuited his genius. This was the only machinery he could employ with propriety; becauſe it
   was the only intervention of ſupernatural beings which agreed with the common belief of the
   country. It was happy; becauſe it did not interfere in the leaſt with the proper diſplay of human
   characters and actions; becauſe it had leſs of the incredible than moſt other kinds of poetical
   machinery; and becauſe it ſerved to diverſify the ſcene, and to heighten the ſubject by an awful
   grandeur, which is the great deſign of machinery.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">As</span> Oſſian's mythology is peculiar to himſelf, and makes a conſiderable
   figure in his other poems, as well as in Fingal, it may be proper to make ſome obſervations on
   it, independent of its ſubſerviency to epic compoſition. It turns

   departed ſpirits. Theſe, conſonantly to the notions of every rude age, are repreſented not as
   purely immaterial, but as thin airy forms, which can be viſible or inviſible at pleaſure; their
   voice is feeble, their arm is weak; but they are endowed with knowledge more than human. In a
   ſeparate ſtate, they retain the ſame diſpoſitions which animated them in this life. They ride on
   the wind; they bend their airy bows; and purſue deer formed of clouds. The ghoſts of departed
   bards continue to ſing. The ghoſts of departed heroes frequent the fields of their former fame.
   “They reſt together in their caves, and talk of mortal men. Their ſongs are of other worlds. They
   come ſometimes to the ear of reſt, and raiſe their feeble voice.” All this preſents to us much
   the ſame ſet of ideas concerning ſpirits, as we find in the eleventh book of the Odyſſey, where
   Ulyſſes viſits the regions of the dead; and in the twenty-third book of the Iliad, the ghoſt of
   Patroclus, after appearing to Achilles, vaniſhes preciſely like one of Oſſian's, emitting a
   ſhrill, feeble cry, and melting away like ſmoke.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> though Homer's and Oſſian's ideas concerning ghoſts were of the ſame
   nature, we cannot but obſerve, that Oſſian's ghoſts are drawn with much ſtronger and livelier

Oſſian deſcribes ghoſts
   with all the particularity of one who had ſeen and converſed with them, and whoſe imagination was
   full of the impreſſion they had left upon it. He calls up thoſe awful and tremendous ideas which
   the <span class="quote">
   <span class="line">—Simulacra modis pallentia miris</span> </span> are fitted to raiſe in the human mind; and
   which, in Shakſpeare's ſtyle, “harrow up the ſoul.” Crugal's ghoſt, in particular, in the
   beginning of the ſecond book of Fingal, may vie with any appearance of this kind, deſcribed by
   any epic or tragic poet whatever. Moſt poets would have contented themſelves, with telling us,
   that he reſembled, in every particular, the living Crugal; that his form and dreſs were the ſame,
   only his face more pale and ſad; and that he bore the mark of the wound by which he fell. But
   Oſſian ſets before our eyes a ſpirit from the inviſible world, diſtinguiſhed by all thoſe
   features which a ſtrong, aſtoniſhed imagination would give to a ghoſt. “A dark red ſtream of fire
   comes down from the hill. Crugal ſat upon the beam; he that lately fell by the band of Swaran,
   ſtriving in the battle of heroes. His face is like the beam of the ſetting moon. His robes are of

His eyes are like two decaying
   flames. Dark is the wound of his breaſt.—The ſtars dim twinkled through his form; and his voice
   was like the ſound of a diſtant ſtream.” The circumſtance of the ſtars being beheld “dim
   twinkling through his form,” is wonderfully pictureſque, and convoys the moſt lively impreſſion
   of his thin and ſhadowy ſubſtance. The attitude in which he is afterward placed, and the ſpeech
   put into his mouth, are full of that ſolemn and awful ſublimity, which ſuits the ſubject. “Dim,
   and in tears he ſtood, and he ſtretched his pale hand over the hero. Faintly he raiſed his feeble
   voice, like the gale of the reedy Lego.—My ghoſt, O Connal! is on my native hills; but my corſe
   is on the ſands of Ulla. Thou ſhalt never talk with Crugal, or find his lone ſteps in the heath.
   I am light as the blaſt of Cromla; and I move like the ſhadow of miſt. Connal, ſon of Colgar! I
   ſee the dark cloud of death; it hovers over the plains of Lena. The ſons of green Erin Shall
   fall. Remove from the field of ghoſts.—Like the darkened moon, he retired in the midſt of the

   ſcenery always ſuited to the occaſion. “Oſcar ſlowly aſcends the hill. The meteors of night ſet
   on the heath before him. A diſtant torrent faintly roars. Unfrequent blaſts ruſh through aged
   oaks. The half enlightened moon ſinks dim and red behind her hill. Feeble voices are heard on the
   heath. Oſcar drew his ſword—.”Nothing can prepare the fancy more happily for the awful ſcene that
   is to follow. “Trenmor came from his hill at the voice of his mighty ſon. A cloud, like the ſteed
   of the ſtranger, ſupported his airy limbs. His robe is of the miſt of Lano, that brings death to
   the people. His ſword is a green meteor, half extinguiſhed. His face is without form, and dark.
   He ſighed thrice over the hero; and thrice the winds of the night roared around. Many were his
   words to Oſcar.—He ſlowly vaniſhed, like a miſt that melts on the ſunny hill.” To appearances of
   this kind, we can find no parallel among the Greek or Roman poets. They bring to mind that noble

   Crugal, which comes to warn the hoſt of impending deſtruction, and to adviſe them to ſave
   themſelves by retreat; that of Evir-allen, the ſpouſe of Oſſian, which calls on him to riſe and
   reſcue their ſon from danger; and that of Agandecca, which, juſt before the laſt engagement with
   Swaran, moves Fingal to pity, by mourning for the approaching deſtruction of her kinſman and
   people. In the other poems, ghoſts ſometimes appear, when invoked, to foretell futurity;
   frequently, according to the notions of theſe times, they come as forerunners of miſfortune or
   death, to thoſe whom they viſit; ſometimes they inform their friends at a diſtance of thier own
   death; and ſometimes they are introduced to heighten the ſcenery on ſome great and ſolemn

The indecent ſquabbles among his

   occaſions. It is indeed a dignity of the dark and awful kind; but this is proper; becauſe
   coincident with the ſtrain and ſpirit of the poetry. A light and gay mythology, like Homer's,
   would have been perfectly unſuitable to the ſubjects on which Oſſian's genius was employed. But
   though his machinery be always ſolemn, it is not, however, always dreary or diſmal; it as
   enlivened, as much as the ſubject would permit, by thoſe pleaſant and beautiful appearances,
   which he ſometimes introduces, of the ſpirits of the hill. Theſe are gentle ſpirits: deſcending
   on ſunbeams, fair moving on the plain; their forms white and bright; their voices ſweet; and
   their viſits to men propitious. The greateſt praiſe that can be given to the beauty of a living
   woman, is to ſay, “She is fair as the ghoſt of the hill, when it moves in a ſunbeam at noon, over
   the ſilence of Morven.” “The hunter ſhall hear my voice from his booth. He ſhall fear, but love

Spirits of a ſuperior

   perfectly conſonant, not only to the peculiar ideas of northern nations, but to the general
   current of a ſuperſtitious mention in all countries. The deſcription of Fingal's airy hall, in
   the poem called Errathon, and of the aſcent of Malvina into it, deſerves particular notice, as
   remarkably noble and magnificent. But, above all, the engagement of Fingal with the ſpirit of
   Loda, in Carric-thura, cannot be mentioned without admiration. I forbear tranſcribing the
   paſſage, as it muſt have drawn the attention of every one who has read the works of Oſſian. The
   undaunted courage of Fingal, oppoſed to all the terrors of the Scandinavian god; the appearance
   and the ſpeech of that awful ſpirit; the wound which he receives, and the ſhriek which he ſends

   it ſo unnatural or wild a fiction as might at firſt be thought. According to the notions of thoſe
   times, ſupernatural beings were material, and, conſequently, vulnerable. The ſpirit of Loda was
   not acknowledged as a deity by Fingal; he did not worſhip at the ſtone of his power; he plainly
   conſidered him as the god of his enemies only; as a local deity, whoſe dominion extended no
   farther than to the regions where he was worſhipped; who had, therefore, no title to threaten
   him, and no claim to his ſubmiſſion. We know there are poetical precedents of great authority,
   for fictions fully as extravagant; and if Homer be forgiven for making Diomed attack and wound in
   battle the gods whom that chief himſelf worſhipped, Oſſian ſurely is pardonable for making his

   diſcovered ſome knowledge of a Supreme Being. Although his ſilence on this head has been
   accounted for by the learned and ingenious tranſlator in a very probable, manner, yet ſtill it
   muſt be held a conſiderable diſadvantage to the poetry. For the moſt auguſt and lofty ideas that
   can embelliſh poetry are derived from the belief of a divine adminiſtration of the univerſe; and
   hence the invocation of a Supreme Being, or at leaſt of ſome ſuperior powers, who are conceived

   all poets, as chief ornaments of their compoſitions. The abſence of all ſuch religious ideas from
   Oſſian's poetry is a ſenſible blank in it; the more to be regretted, as we can eaſily imagine
   what an illuſtrious figure they would have made under the management of ſuch a genius as his; and
   how finely they would have been adapted to many ſituations which occur in his works.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">After</span> ſo particular an examination of Fingal, it were needleſs to enter into
   as full a diſcuſſion of the conduct of Temora, the other epic poem. Many of the ſame
   obſervations, eſpecially with regard to the great characteriſtics of heroic poetry, apply to
   both. The high merit, however, of Temora, requires that we ſhould not paſs it by without ſome
   remarks.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſcene of Temora, as of Fingal, is laid in Ireland; and the action is of

   uſurper, and to reſtore the poſſeſſion of the kingdom to the poſterity of the lawful prince: an
   undertaking worthy of the juſtice and heroiſm of the great Fingal. The action is one, and
   complete. The Poem opens with the deſcent of Fingal on the coaſt, and the conſultation held among
   the chiefs of the enemy. The murder of the young

   war, being antecedent to the epic action, is introduced with great propriety as an epiſode in the
   firſt book. In the progreſs of the poem, three battles are deſcribed, which riſe in their
   importance above, one another; the ſucceſs is various, and the iſſue for ſome time doubtful; till
   at laſt, Fingal, brought into diſtreſs, by the wound of his great general Gaul, and the death of
   his ſon Fillan, aſſumes the command himſelf; and, having ſlain the Iriſh king in ſingle combat,
   reſtores the rightful heir to his throne.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Temora</span> has perhaps leſs fire than the other epic poem; but in return it has
   more variety, more tenderneſs, and more magnificence. The reigning idea, ſo often reſented to us,
   of “Fingal, in the laſt of his fields, is venerable and affecting; nor could any more noble
   concluſion be thought of, than the aged hero, after ſo many ſucceſſful achievements, taking his
   leave of battles, and, with all the ſolemnities of thoſe times, reſigning his ſpear to his ſon.
   The events are leſs crowded in Temora than in Fingal; actions and characters are more

   Oſſian's genius, occaſion a fine diverſity in the poem; and are happily contraſted with the
   military operations of the day.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> moſt of our author's poems, the horrors of war are ſoftened by intermixed
   ſcenes of love and friendſhip. In Fingal theſe are introduced as epiſodes: in Temora we have an
   incident of this nature wrought into the body of the piece, in the adventure of Cathmor and
   Sulmalla. This forms one of the moſt conſpicuous beauties of that poem. The diſtreſs of Sulmalla,
   diſguiſed and unknown amongſt ſtrangers, her tender and anxious concern for the ſafety of
   Cathmor, her dream, and her melting remembrance of the land of her fathers; Cathmor's emotion
   when he firſt diſcovers her, his ſtruggles to conceal and ſuppreſs his paſſion, leſt it ſhould
   unman him in the midſt of war, though “his ſoul poured forth in ſecret, when he beheld her
   fearful eye,” and the laſt interview between them, when, overcome by her tenderneſs, he lets her
   know he had diſcovered her, and confeſſes his paſſion; are all wrought up with the moſt exquiſite
   ſenſibility and delicacy.</p>

   feature, they are nevertheleſs diverſified in a ſenſible and ſtriking manner. Foldath, for
   inſtance, the general of Cathmor, exhibits the perfect picture of a ſavage chieftain; bold and
   daring, but preſumptuous, cruel, and overbearing. He is diſtinguiſhed, on his firſt appearance,
   as the friend of the tyrant Cairbar, “His ſtride is haughty; his red eye rolls in wrath.” In his
   perſon and whole deportment he is contraſted with the mild and wiſe Hidalla, another leader of
   the ſame army, on whoſe humanity and gentleneſs he looks with great contempt. He profeſſedly
   delights in ſtrife and blood. He inſults over the fallen. He is imperious in his counſels, and
   factious when they are not followed. He is unrelenting in all his ſchemes of revenge, even to the
   length of denying the funeral ſong to the dead; which, from the injury thereby done to their
   ghoſts, was in thoſe days conſidered as the greateſt barbarity. Fierce to the laſt, he comforts
   himſelf in his dying moments with thinking that his ghoſt ſhall often leave its blaſt to rejoice
   over the graves of thoſe he had ſlain. Yet Oſſian, ever prone to the pathetic, has contrived to
   throw into his account of the death, even of this man, ſome tender

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> character of Foldath tends much to exalt that of Cathmor, the chief
   commander, which is diſtinguiſhed by the moſt humane virtues. He all fraud and cruelty, is famous
   for his hoſpitality to ſtrangers; open to every generous ſentiment, and to every ſoft and
   compaſſionate feeling. he is ſo amiable as to divide the reader's attachment between him and the
   hero of the poem; though our author has artfully managed it ſo as to make Cathmor himſelf
   indirectly acknowledge Fingal's ſuperiority, and to appear ſomewhat apprehenſive of the event,
   after the death of Fillan, which he knew would call forth Fingal in all his might. It is very
   remarkable, that although Oſſian has introduced into his poems three complete heroes, Cuthullin,
   Cathmor, and Fingal, he has, however, ſenſibly diſtinguiſhed each of their characters; Cuthullin

   young warrior, fired with all the impatient enthuſiaſm for military glory peculiar to that time
   of life. He had ſketched this in the deſcription of his own ſon Oſcar; but as he has extended it
   more fully in Fillan, and as the character is ſo conſonant to the epic ſtrain, though, as far as
   I remember, not placed in ſuch a conſpicuous light by any other epic poet, it may be worth while
   to attend a little to Oſſian's management of it in this inſtance.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Fillan</span> was the youngeſt of all the ſons of Fingal younger, it is plain, than
   his nephew Oſcar, by whoſe fame and great deeds in war we may naturally ſuppoſe his ambition to
   have been highly ſtimulated. Withal, as lie is younger, he is deſcribed as more raſh and fiery.
   His firſt appearance is ſoon after Oſcar's death, when he was employed to watch the motions of
   the foe by night. In a converſation with his brother Oſſian, on that occaſion, we learn that it
   was not long ſince he began to lift the ſpear. “Few are the marks of my ſword in battle; but my
   ſoul is fire.” He is with ſome difficulty reſtrained by Oſſian from going to attack the enemy;
   and complains to him, that his father had never allowed him any opportunity of ſignalizing his
   valor. “The king hath not

   crowd; I return without my fame.” Soon after, when Fingal, according to cuſtom, was to appoint
   one of his chiefs to command the army, and each was ſtanding forth, and putting in his claim to
   this honour, Fillan is preſented in the following moſt pictureſque and natural attitude: “On his
   ſpear ſtood the Son of Clatho, in the wandering of his locks. Thrice he raiſed his eyes to
   Fingal; his voice thrice failed him as he ſpoke. Fillan could not boaſt of battles; at once he
   ſtrode away. Bent over a diſtant ſtream he ſtood; the tear hung in his eye. He ſtruck, at times,
   the thiſtle's head with his inverted ſpear.” No leſs natural and beautiful is the deſcription of
   Fingal's paternal emotion on this occaſion. “Nor is he unſeen of Fingal. Sidelong he beheld his
   ſon. He beheld him with burſting joy. He hid the big tear with his locks, and turned amidſt his
   crowded ſoul.” The command, for that day, being given to Gaul, Fillan ruſhes amidſt the thickeſt
   of the foe, ſaves Gaul's life, who is wounded by a random arrow, and diſtinguiſhes himſelf ſo in
   battle, that “the days of old return on Fingal's mind, as he beholds the renown of his ſon. As
   the ſun rejoices from the cloud, over the tree his beams have raiſed,

   heath, ſo joyful is the king over Fillan.” Sedate, however, and wiſe, he mixes the praiſe which
   he beſtows on him with ſome reprehenſion of his raſhneſs. “My ſon, I ſaw thy deeds, and my ſoul
   was glad. Thou art brave, ſon of Clatho, but headlong in the ſtrife. So did not Fingal advance,
   though he never feared a foe. Let thy people be a ridge behind thee; they are thy ſtrength in the
   field. Then ſhalt thou be long renowned, and behold the tombs of thy fathers.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">On </span>the next day, the, greateſt and the laſt of Fillan's life, the charge is
   committed to him of leading on the hoſt to battle. Fingal's ſpeech to his troops on this occaſion
   is full of noble ſentiment; and, where he recommends his ſon to their care, extremely touching.
   “A young beam is before you: few are his ſteps to war. They are few, but he is valiant; defend my
   dark-haired ſon. Bring him back with joy; hereafter he may ſtand alone. His form is like his
   fathers; his ſoul is a flame of their fire.” When the battle begins, the poet puts forth his
   ſtrength to deſcribe the exploits of the young hero; who, at laſt encountering and killing with
   his own hand Foldath, the oppoſite general, attains the pinnacle of glory. In what

   near, Oſſian, if anywhere, excels himſelf. Foldath being ſlain, and a general rout begun, there
   was no reſource left to the enemy but in the great Cathmore himſelf, who in this extremity
   deſcends from the hill, where, according to the cuſtom of thoſe princes, he ſurveyed the battle.
   Obſerve how this critical event is wrought up by the poet. “Wide-ſpreading over echoing Lubar,
   the flight of Bolga is rolled along. Fillan hung forward on their ſteps, and ſtrewed the heath
   with dead. Fingal rejoiced over his ſon.—Blue-ſhielded Cathmor roſe.—Son of Alpin, bring the
   harp! Give Fillan's praiſe to the wind: raiſe high his praiſe in my hall, while yet he ſhines in
   war. Leave, blue-eyed Clatho! leave thy hall; behold that early beam of thine! The hoſt is
   withered in its courſe. No farther look—it is dark—light trembling from the harp, ſtrike,
   virgins! ſtrike the ſound.” The ſudden interruption and ſuſpenſe of the narration on Cathmor's
   riſing from his hill, the abrupt burſting into the praiſe of Fillan, and the paſſionate
   apoſtrophe to his mother Clatho, are admirable efforts of poetical art, in order to intereſt us
   in Fillan's danger; and the whole is heightened by the immediate following ſimile,

   is to be met with in any poet, and which, if it had been found in Homer, would have been the
   frequent ſubject of admiration to critics: “Fillan is like a ſpirit of heaven, that deſcends from
   the ſkirt of big blaſt. The troubled ocean feels his ſteps as he ſtrides from wave to wave. His
   path kindles behind him; iſlands ſhake their heads on the heaving ſeas.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> the poet's art is not yet exhauſted. The fall of this noble young,
   warrior, or, in Oſſian's ſtyle, the extinction of this beam of heaven, could not be rendered too
   intereſting and affecting. Our attention is naturally drawn towards Fingal. He beholds front his
   hill the riſing of Cathmor, and the danger of his ſon. But what ſhall he do? “Shall Fingal riſe
   to his aid, and take the ſword of Luno? What then ſhall become of thy fame, ſon of white-boſomed
   Clatho? Turn not thine eves from Fingal, daughter of Iniſtore! I ſhall not quench thy early beam.
   No cloud of mine ſhall riſe, my ſon, upon thy ſoul of fire.” Struggling between concern for the
   fame, and fear for the ſafety of his ſon, be withdraws from the ſight of the engagement, and
   deſpatches Oſſian in haſte to the field,

   injunction: “Father of Oſcar!” addreſſing him by a title which on this occaſion has the higheſt
   propriety: “Father of Oſcar! lift the ſpear, defend the young in arms. But conceal thy ſteps from
   Fillan's eyes. He muſt not know that I doubt his ſteel.” Oſſian arrived too late. But unwilling
   to deſcribe Fillan vanquiſhed, the poet ſuppreſſes all the circumſtances of the combat with
   Cathmor; and only ſhews us the dying hero. We ſee him animated to the end with the ſame martial
   and ardent ſpirit; breathing his laſt in bitter regret for-being ſo early cut off from the field
   of glory. “Oſſian, lay me in that hollow rock. Raiſe no ſtone above me, leſt one ſhould aſk about
   my fame. I am fallen in the firſt of my fields; fallen without renown. Let thy voice alone ſend
   joy to my flying ſoul. Why ſhould the bard know where dwells the early-fallen Fillan?” He who,
   after tracing the circumſtances of this ſtory, ſhall deny that our bard is poſſeſſed of high
   ſentiment and high art, muſt be ſtrangely prejudiced indeed. Let him read the ſtory of Pallas in

I waive inſiſting on any
   more of the particulars in Temora; as my aim is rather to lead the reader into the genius and
   ſpirit of Oſſian's poetry, than to dwell on all his beauties.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> judgment and art diſcovered in conducting works of ſuch length as Fingal
   and Temora, diſtinguiſh them from the other poems in this collection. The ſmaller pieces,
   however, contain particular beauties, no leſs eminent. They are hiſtorical poems, generally of
   the elegiac kind; and plainly diſcover themſelves to be the work of the ſame author. One
   conſiſtent face of manners is everywhere preſented to us; one ſpirit of poetry reigns; the
   maſterly hand of Oſſian appears throughout; the ſame rapid and animated ſtyle; the ſame ſtrong
   colouring of imagination, and the ſame glowing ſenſibility of heart. Beſides the unity which
   belongs to the compoſitions of one man, there is moreover a certain unity of ſubject, which very
   happily connects all theſe poems. They form the poetical hiſtory of the age, of Fingal, The ſame
   race of heroes whom we had met with in the greater poems, Cuthullin, Oſcar, Connar, and Gaul,
   return again upon the ſtage; and Fingal himſelf is always the principal figure, preſented on
   every occaſion, with equal

   laſt. The circumſtances of Oſſian's old age and blindneſs, his ſurviving all his friends, and his
   relating their great exploits to Malvina, the ſpouſe or miſtreſs of his beloved ſon Oſcar,
   furniſh the fineſt poetical ſituations that fancy could deviſe for that tender pathetic which
   reigns in Oſſian's poetry.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">On</span> each of theſe poems there might be room for ſeparate obſervations, with
   regard to he conduct and diſpoſitions of the incidents, as well as to the beauty of the
   deſcriptions and ſentiments. Carthon is a regular and highly finiſhed piece. The main ſtory is
   very properly introduced by Cleſſamore's relation of the adventure of his youth; and this
   introduction is finely heightened by Fingal's ſong of mourning over Moina; in which Oſſian, ever
   fond of doing honour to his father, has contrived to diſtinguiſh him for being an eminent poet,
   as well as warrior. Fingal's ſong upon this occaſion, when “his thouſand bards leaned forwards
   from their ſeats, to hear the voice of the king,” is inferior to no paſſage in the whole book;
   and with great judgement put in his mouth, as the ſeriouſneſs, no leſs than the ſublimity of the
   ſtrain, is peculiarly ſuited to the hero's character. In Darthula are

   can touch the heart of man, friendſhip, love, the affections of parents, ſons, and brothers, the
   diſtreſs of the aged, and the unavailing bravery of the young. The beautiful addreſs to the moon,
   with which the poem opens, and the tranſition from thence to the ſubject, moſt happily prepare
   the mind for that train of affecting events that is to follow. The ſtory is regular, dramatic,
   intereſting to the laſt. He who can read it without emotion may congratulate himſelf, if he
   pleaſes, upon being completely armed againſt ſympathetic ſorrow. As Fingal had no occaſion of
   appearing in the action of this poem, Oſſian makes a very artful tranſition from his narration,
   to what was paſſing in the halls of Selma. The ſound heard there on the ſtrings of his harp, the
   concern which Fingal ſhews on bearing it, and the invocation of the ghoſts of their fathers, to
   receive the heroes falling in a diſtant land, are introduced with great beauty of imagination to
   increaſe the ſolemnity, and to diverſify the ſcenery of the poem.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Carric-thura</span> is full of the moſt ſublime dignity; and has this advantage, of

   ſeems to have been the great delight of Oſſian and the bards of his age. Lathmon is peculiarly
   diſtinguiſhed by high generoſity of ſentiment. This is carried ſo far, particularly in the
   refuſal of Gaul, on one ſide, to take the advantage of a ſleeping foe; and of Lathmon, on the
   other, to overpower by numbers the two young warriors as to recall into one's mind the manners of
   chivalry; ſome reſemblance to which may perhaps be ſuggeſted by other incidents in this
   collection of poems. Chivalry, however, took riſe in an age and country too remote from thoſe of
   Oſſian, to admit the ſuſpicion that the one could have borrowed any thing from the other. So far
   as chivalry had any real exiſtence, the ſame military enthuſiaſm which gave birth to it in the
   feudal times, might, in the days of Oſſian, that is, in the infancy of a riſing ſtate, through
   the operation of the ſame cauſe, very naturally produce effects of the ſame kind on the minds and
   manners of men. So far as chivalry was an ideal ſyſtem, exiſting only in romance, it will not be
   thought ſurpriſing, when we reflect on the account before given of the Celtic bards, that this
   imaginary refinement of heroic manners ſhould be found among them, as much, at leaſt, as among

   gallantry and generoſity of thoſe fabulous knights, without their extravagance; and his love
   ſcenes have native tenderneſs, without any mixture of thoſe forced and unnatural conceits which
   abound in the old romances. The adventures related by our poet which reſemble the moſt thoſe of
   romance, concern women who follow their lovers to war diſguiſed in the armour of men; and theſe
   are ſo managed as to produce, in the diſcovery, ſeveral of the moſt intereſting ſituations; one

   would have been admired in any poet of the moſt refined age. The conduct of Cruma muſt ſtrike
   every reader as remarkably judicious and beautiful. We are to be prepared for the death of
   Malvina, which is related in the ſucceeding poem. She is therefore introduced in perſon; “ſhe has
   heard a voice in her dream; She feels the fluttering of her ſoul:” and in a moſt moving
   lamentation addreſſed to her beloved Oſcar, ſhe ſings her own death-ſong. Nothing could be
   calculated with more art to ſooth and comfort her than the ſtory which Oſſian relates. In the
   young and brave Fovargormo, another Oſcar is introduced: his praiſes are ſung; and the happineſs
   is ſet before her of thoſe who die in their youth “when their renown is around them; before the
   feeble behold them in the hall, and ſmile at their trembling hands.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> nowhere does Oſſian's genius appear to greater advantage, than in

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> whole train of ideas is admirably ſuited to the ſubject. Every thing is
   full of that inviſible world, into which the aged bard believes himſelf now ready to enter. The
   airy ball of Fingal preſents itſelf to his view; “he ſees the cloud that ſhall receive his ghoſt;
   he beholds the miſt that ſhall form his robe when he appears on his hill;” and all the natural
   objects around him ſeem to carry the preſages of death. “The thiſtle ſhakes its beard to the
   wind. The flower hangs its heavy head; it ſeems to any, I am covered with the drops of heaven;
   the time of my departure is near, and the blaſt that ſhall ſcatter my leaves.” Malvina's death is
   hinted to him in the moſt delicate manner by the ſon of Alpin. His lamentation over her, her
   apotheoſis, or aſcent to the habitation of heroes, and the introduction to the ſtory which
   follows from the mention which Oſſian ſuppoſes the father of Malvina to make of him in the ball
   of Fingal, are all in the higheſt ſpirit of poetry. “And doſt thou remember Oſſian, O Toſcar, ſon
   of Conloch? The battles of our youth were many; our ſwords went together to the field.” Nothing
   could be more proper than to end his ſongs with recording an exploit of the father of that

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſcene of moſt of Oſſian's poems is laid in Scotland, or in the coaſt of
   Ireland, oppoſite to the territories of Fingal. When the ſcene is in Ireland, we perceive no
   change of manners from thoſe of Oſſian's native country. For as Ireland was undoubtedly peopled
   with Celtic tribes, the language, cuſtoms, and religion of both nations were the ſame. They had
   been ſeparated from one another by migration, only a few generations, as it ſhould ſeem, before
   our poet's age; and they ſtill maintained a cloſe and frequent intercourſe. But when the poet
   relates the expeditions of any of his heroes to the Scandinavian coaſt, or to the iſlands of
   Orkney, which were then part of the Scandinavian territory, as he does in Carric-thura, Sul-malla
   of Lumon, and Cathloda, the caſe is quite altered. Thoſe countries were inhabited by nations of
   the Teutonic deſcent, who, in their manners and religious rites, differed widely from the Celtæ;
   and it is curious and remarkable, to find this difference clearly pointed out in the poems of
   Oſſian. His deſcriptions bear the native marks of one who was preſent in the expeditions which he
   relates, and who deſcribes what he had ſeen with his own eyes. No ſooner are we carried to

   are in a foreign region. New objects begin to appear. We meet everywhere with the ſtones and
   circles of Loda, that is, Odin, the great Scandinavian deity. We meet with the divinations and
   enchantments for which it is well known thoſe northern nations were early famous. “There, mixed
   with the murmur of waters, roſe the voice of aged men, who called the forms of night to aid them
   in their war;” whilſt the Caledonian chiefs, who aſſiſted them, are deſcribed as ſtanding at a
   diſtance, heedleſs of their rites. That ferocity of manners which diſtinguiſhed thoſe nations,
   alſo becomes conſpicuous. In the combats of their chiefs there is a peculiar ſavageneſs; even
   their women are bloody and fierce. The ſpirit. and the very ideas of Regner Lodbrog, that
   northern ſcalder, whom I formerly quoted, occur to us again. “The hawks,” Oſſian makes one of the
   Scandinavian chiefs ſay, “ruſh from all their winds; they are wont to trace my courſe. We
   rejoiced three days above the dead, and called the hawks of heaven, They came from all their
   winds, to feaſt on the foes of Annir.”</p>

   diſcerns nothing new or peculiar in the object he means to deſcribe. His conceptions of it are
   vague and looſe; his expreſſions feeble; and of courſe the object is preſented to us
   indiſtinctly, and as through a cloud. But a true poet makes us imagine that we ſee it before our
   eyes; he catches the diſtinguiſhing features; he gives it the colours of life and reality; he
   places it in ſuch a light that a painter could copy after him. This happy talent is chiefly owing
   to a lively imagination, which firſt receives a ſtrong impreſſion of the object; and then, by a
   proper ſelection of capital pictureſque circumſtances employed in deſcribing it, tranſmits that
   impreſſion in its full force to the imaginations of others. That Oſſian poſſeſſes this
   deſcriptive power in a high degree, we have a clear proof, from the effect which his deſcriptions
   produce upon the imaginations of thoſe who read him with any degree of attention, or taſte. Few
   poets are more intereſting. We contract an intimate

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">It</span> were eaſy to point out ſeveral inſtances of exquiſite painting in the
   works of our author. Such, for inſtance, is the ſcenery with which Temora opens, and the attitude
   in which Cairbar is there preſented to us; the deſcription of the young prince Cormac, in the
   ſame book; and the ruins of Balclutha, in Cartho. “I have ſeen the walls of Balclutha, but they
   were deſolate. The fire had reſounded in the balls: and the voice of the people is heard no more.
   The ſtream of Clutha was removed from its place by the fall of the walls. The thiſtle ſhook there

   and my tears deſcended with night. Shall I not fight, I ſaid to my ſoul, againſt the children of
   my foes? And I will fight, O bard! I feel the ſtrength of my ſoul.” In the ſame poem, the
   aſſembling of the chiefs round Fingal, who had been warned of ſome impending danger by the
   appearance of a prodigy, is deſcribed with ſo many pictureſque circumſtances, that one imagines
   himſelf preſent in the aſſembly. “The king alone beheld the terrible ſight, and he foreſaw the
   death of his people. He came in ſilence to his hall, and took his father's ſpear: the mail

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">It</span> has been objected to Oſſian, that his deſcriptions of military actions
   are imperfect, and much leſs diverſified by the circumſtances than thoſe of Homer. This is in
   ſome meaſure true. The amazing fertility of Homer's invention, is nowhere ſo much diſplayed as in
   the incidents of his battles, and in the little hiſtory pieces he gives of the perſons ſlain.
   Nor, indeed, with regard to the talent of deſcription, can too much be ſaid in praiſe of Homer.
   Every thing is alive in his writings. The colours with which he paints are thoſe of nature. But
   Oſſian's genius was of a different kind from Homer's. It led him to hurry towards grand objects,
   rather than to amuſe himſelf with particulars of leſs importance. He could dwell on the death of
   a favourite hero; but that of a private man ſeldom ſtopped his rapid courſe. Homer's genius was
   more comprehenſive than Oſſian's. It included a wider circle of objects; and could work up any
   incident into deſcription. Oſſian's was more limited; but the region within which it

   all, the region of the pathetic and the ſublime.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">We</span> muſt not imagine, however, that Oſſian's battles conſiſt only of general
   indiſtinct deſcription. Such beautiful incidents are ſometimes introduced, and the circumſtances
   of the perſons ſlain ſo much diverſified, as ſhow that be could have embelliſhed his military
   ſcenes with an abundant variety of particulars, if his genius had led him to dwell upon them.
   “One man is ſtretched in the duſt of his native land; he fell, where often he had ſpread the
   feaſt, and often raiſed the voice of the harp.” The maid of Iniſtore is introduced in a moving
   apoſtrophe, as weeping for another; and a third, “as rolled in the duſt he lifted his faint eyes
   to the king,” is remembered and mourned by Fingal as the friend of Agandecca. The blood pouring
   from the wound of one who was ſlain by night, is heard “hiſſing on the half-extinguiſhed oak,”
   which had been kindled for giving light. Another climbing up a tree to eſcape from his foe, is
   pierced by his ſpear from behind; ſhrieking, panting he fell; whilſt moſs and withered branches

   lie looked to the foe with joy. We ſpoke the words of friendſhip in ſecret; and the lightning of
   our ſwords poured together. We drew them behind the wood, and tried the ſtrength of our arms on
   the empty air.`</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Oſſian</span> is always conciſe in his deſcriptions, which adds much to their
   beauty and force. For it is a great miſtake to imagine, that a crowd of particulars, or a very
   fall and extended ſtyle, is of advantage to deſcription. On the contrary, ſuch a diffuſe manner
   for the moſt part weakens it. Any one redundant circumſtance is a nuiſance. It encumbers and
   loads the fancy, and renders the main image indiſtinct. “Obſtat,” as Quintilian ſays with regard
   to ſtyle, “quicquid non adjuvat.” To be conciſe in deſcription, is one thing: and to be general,
   is another. No deſcription that reſts in generals can poſſibly be good; it can convey no lively
   idea; for it is of particulars only that we have a diſtinct conception. But, at the ſame time, no
   ſtrong imagination dwells long upon any one particular; or heaps together a maſs of trivial ones.

   one glance than a feeble imagination is able to do, by turning its object round and round into a
   variety of lights. Tacitus is of all proſe writers the moſt conciſe. He has even a degree of
   abruptneſs reſembling our author: yet no writer is more eminent for lively deſcription. When
   Fingal, after having conquered the haughty Swaran, propoſes to diſmiſs him with honour: “Raiſe
   to-morrow thy white ſails to the wind, thou brother of Agandecca!” he conveys, by thus addreſſing
   his enemy, a ſtronger impreſſion of the emotions then paſſing within his mind, than if whole
   paragraphs had been ſpent in deſcribing the conflict between reſentment againſt Swaran and the
   tender remembrance of his ancient love. No amplification is needed to give us the moſt full idea
   of a hardy veteran, after the few following words: “His ſhield is marked with the ſtrokes of
   battle; his red eye deſpiſes danger.” When Oſcar left alone, was ſurrounded by foes, “he ſtood,”
   it is ſaid, “growing in his place, like the flood of the narrow vale;” a happy repreſentation of
   one, who, by daring intrepidity in the midſt of danger, ſeems to increaſe in his appearance, and
   becomes more formidable every moment, like the ſudden riſing of the torrent hemmed in

And a whole crowd of ideas,
   concerning the circumſtances of domeſtic ſorrow, occaſioned by a young warrior's firſt going
   forth to battle, is poured upon the mind by theſe words: “Calmar leaned on his father's ſpear;
   that ſpear which he brought from Lara's hall, when the ſoul of his mother was ſad.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> conciſeneſs of Oſſian's deſcriptions is the more proper, on account of
   his ſubjects. Deſcriptions of gay and ſmiling ſcenes may, without any diſadvantage, be amplified
   and prolonged. Force is not the predominant quality expected in theſe. The deſcription may be
   weakened by being diffuſe, yet, notwithſtanding, may be beautiful ſtill; whereas, with reſpect to
   grand, ſolemn, and pathetic ſubjects, which are Oſſian's chief field, the caſe is very different.
   In theſe, energy is above all things required. The imagination muſt be ſeized at once, or not at
   all; and is far more deeply impreſſed by one ſtrong and ardent image, than by the anxious
   minuteneſs of labored illuſtration.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> Oſſian's genius, though chiefly turned towards the ſublime and pathetic,
   was not confined to it. In ſubjects alſo of grace and delicacy, he diſcovers the hand of a
   maſter. Take for an example the following elegant deſcription of Agandecca, wherein the
   tenderneſs of Tibullus

   “The daughter of the ſnow overheard, and left the hall of her ſecret ſigh. She came in all her
   beauty; like the moon from the cloud of the eaſt. Lovelineſs was around her as light. Her ſteps
   were like the muſic of ſongs. She ſaw the youth and loved him. He was the ſtolen ſigh of her
   ſoul. Her blue eyes rolled on him in ſecret; and ſhe bleſt the chief of Morven.” Several other
   inſtances might be produced of the feelings of love and friendſhip, painted by our author with a
   moſt natural and happy delicacy.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſimplicity of Oſſian's manner adds great beauty to his deſcriptions, and
   indeed to his whole poetry. We meet with no affected ornaments; no forced refinement; no marks
   either in ſtyle or thought of a ſtudied endeavor to ſhine or ſparkle. Oſſian appears everywhere
   to be prompted by his feelings; and to ſpeak from the abundance of his heart. I remember no more
   than one inſtance of what may be called a quaint thought in this whole collection of his works.
   It is in the firſt book of Fingal, where, from the tombs of two lovers, two lonely yews are
   mentioned to have ſprung, “whoſe branches wiſhed to meet on high.” This ſympathy of the trees
   with the lovers, may be reckoned to

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> “joy of grief” is one of Oſſian's remarkable expreſſions, ſeveral times
   repeated. If any one ſhall think that it needs to be juſtified by a precedent, he may find it
   twice uſed by Homer: in the Iliad, when Achilles is viſited by the ghoſt of Patroclus; and in the
   Odyſſey, when Ulyſſes meets his mother in the ſhades. On both theſe occaſions, the heroes, melted
   with tenderneſs, lament their not having it in their power to throw their arms round the ghoſt,
   “that we might,” ſay they, “in mutual embrace, enjoy the delight of grief. “ <span class="quote">

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> in truth, the expreſſion ſtands in need of no defence from authority;
   for it is a natural and juſt expreſſion; and conveys a clear idea of that gratification which a
   virtuous heart often feels in the indulgence of a tender melancholy. Oſſian makes a very proper
   diſtinction between this gratification and the deſtructive effect of overpowering grief. “There
   is a joy in grief when peace dwells in the breaſts of the ſad. But ſorrow waſtes the mournful, O
   daughter of Toſcar, and their days are few.” To “give the joy of grief,” generally ſignifies to

   and finely characterizes the taſte of Oſſian's age and country. In thoſe days, when the ſongs of
   bards were the great delight of heroes, the tragic muſe was hold in chief honour: gallant actions
   and virtuous ſufferings, were the choſen theme; preferably to that light and trifling ſtrain, of
   poetry and muſic, which promotes light and trifling manners, and ſerves to emaſculate the mind.
   “Strike the harp in my hall,” ſaid the great Fingal, in the midſt of youth and victory; “ſtrike
   the harp in my hall, and let Fingal hear the ſong. Pleaſant is the joy of grief! It is like the
   ſhower O of ſpring, when it ſoftens the branch of the oak; and the young leaf lifts its green
   head. Sing on, O bards! To-morrow we lift the ſail.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Perſonal</span> epithets have been much uſed by all the poets of the moſt ancient
   ages; and when well choſen, not general and unmeaning, they contribute not a little to render the
   ſtyle deſcriptive and animated. Beſides epithets founded on bodily diſtinctions, akin to many of
   Homer's, we find in Oſſian ſeveral which are remarkably beautiful and poetical. Such as Oſcar of
   the future fights, Fingal of the mildeſt look, Carril of other times, the mildly bluſhing

  <p class="noindent">A poetical<span class="sc"/> ſimile always ſuppoſes two objects brought together, between which
   there is ſome near relation or connection in the fancy. What that relation ought to be, cannot be
   preciſely defined. For various, almoſt numberleſs, are the analogies formed among objects, by a
   ſprightly imagination. The relation of actual ſimilitude, or likeneſs of appearance, is far from
   being the only foundation of poetical compariſon. Sometimes a reſemblance in the effect produced
   by two objects, is made the connecting principle: ſometimes a reſemblance in one diſtinguiſhing
   property or circumſtance. Very often two objects are brought together in a ſimile, though they
   reſemble one another, ſtrictly ſpeaking, in nothing, only becauſe they raiſe in the mind a train
   of ſimilar, and what may be called concordant, ideas; ſo that the remembrance of the one, when
   recalled, ſerves to quicken and heighten the impreſſion made by the other. Thus, to give an

   looks back on the exploits of his youth, has certainly no direct reſemblance to the beauty of a
   fine evening; further than that both agree in producing a certain calm, placid joy. Yet Oſſian
   has founded upon this, one of the moſt beautiful compariſons that is to be met with in any poet.
   “Wilt thou not liſten, ſon of the rock, to the ſong of Oſſian? My ſoul is full of other times;
   the joy of my youth returns. Thus the ſun appears in the weſt, after the ſteps of his brightneſs
   have moved behind a ſtorm. The green hills lift their dewy heads. The blue ſtreams rejoice in the
   vale. The aged hero comes forth on his ſtaff; and his gray hair glitters in the beam.” Never was
   there a finer group of objects. It raiſes a ſtrong conception of the old man's joy and elation of
   heart, by diſplaying a ſcene which produces in every ſpectator a correſponding train of pleaſing
   emotions; the declining ſun looking forth in his brightneſs after a ſtorm; the cheerful face of
   all nature; and the ſtill life finely animated by the circumſtance of the aged hero, with his
   ſtaff and his gray locks: a circumſtance both extremely pictureſque, in itſelf, and peculiarly
   ſuited to the main object of the compariſon. Such analogies and aſſociations of ideas as theſe,
   are highly pleaſing to the fancy. They give

   objects, and remarking the differences among thoſe which ſeem alike, ſo the higheſt amuſement of
   the imagination is to trace likeneſſes and agreements among thoſe which ſeem different.</p>

   which he ſees around him, and which have often ſtruck his fancy. For this reaſon, In order to
   judge of the propriety of poetical imagery, we ought to be in ſome meaſure acquainted with the
   natural hiſtory of the country where the ſcene of the poem is laid. The introduction of foreign
   images betrays a poet, copying not from nature, but from other writers. Hence ſo many lions, and
   tigers, and eagles, and ſerpents, which we meet, with in the ſimiles of modern poets; as if theſe
   animals had acquired ſome right to a place in poetical compariſons for ever, becauſe employed by
   ancient authors. They employed them with propriety, as objects generally known in their, country,
   but they are abſurdly uſed for illuſtration by us, who know them only at ſecond hand, or by
   deſcription. To moſt readers of modern poetry, it were more to the purpoſe to deſcribe lions or
   tigers by ſimiles taken from men, than to compare men to lions. Oſſian is very correct in this
   particular. His imagery is, without exception, copied from that face of nature which be ſaw
   before his eyes; and by conſequence may be expected to be lively. We meet with no Grecian or
   Italian ſcenery; but with the miſts and clouds, and ſtorms, of a northern mountainous region.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">No</span> poet abounds more in ſimiles than Oſſian. There are in this collection as
   many, at leaſt, as in the whole Iliad and Odyſſey of Homer. I am indeed inclined to think, that
   the works of both poets are too much crowded with them. Similes are ſparkling ornaments; and,
   like all things that ſparkle, are apt to dazzle and tire us by their luſtre. But if Oſſian's
   ſimiles be too frequent, they have this advantage, of being commonly ſhorter than Homer's; they
   interrupt his narration leſs; he juſt glances aſide to ſome reſembling, object, and inſtantly
   returns to his former track. Homer's ſimiles include a wider range of objects; but, in return,
   Oſſian's, are, without exception, taken from objects of dignity, which cannot be ſaid for all
   thoſe which Homer employs. The ſun, the moon, and the ſtars, clouds and meteors, lightning and
   thunder, ſeas and whales, rivers, torrents, winds, ice, rain, ſnow, dews, miſt, fire and ſmoke,
   trees and foreſts, heath and graſs and flowers, rocks and mountains, muſic and ſongs, light and
   darkneſs, ſpirits and ghoſts; theſe form the circle within which Oſſian's compariſons generally
   run. Some, not many, are taken from birds and beaſts: as eagles, ſea-fowl, the horſe, the deer,
   and the mountain bee; and a very few from ſuch operations of art as were then known.

   more alluſions to the animal world; to lions, bulls, goats, herds of cattle, ſerpents, inſects;
   and to various occupations of rural and paſtoral life. Oſſian's defect in this article, is
   plainly owing to the deſert, uncultivated ſtate of his country, which ſuggeſted to him few images
   beyond natural inanimate objects, in their rudeſt form. The birds and animals of the country were
   probably not numerous; and his acquaintance with them was ſlender, as they were little ſubjected
   to the uſes of man.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> great objection made to Oſſian's imagery, is its uniformity, and the too
   frequent repetition of the ſame compariſon. In a work ſo thick-ſown with ſimiles one could not
   but expect to find images of the ſame kind ſometimes ſuggeſted to the poet by reſembling objects;
   eſpecially to a poet like Oſſian, who wrote from the immediate impulſe of poetical enthuſiaſm,
   and without much preparation of ſtudy or labor. Fertile as Homer's imagination is acknowledged to
   be, who does not know how often his lions, and bulls, and flocks of ſheep, recur with little or
   no variation; nay, ſometimes, in the very ſame words? The objection made to Oſſian is, however,
   founded, in a great meaſure, upon a miſtake. It has been ſuppoſed

   moon, the cloud, or the thunder, returns in a ſimile, it is the ſame ſimile, and the ſame moon,
   or cloud, or thunder, which they had met with a few pages before. Whereas very often the ſimiles
   are widely different. The object, from whence they are taken, is indeed in ſubſtance the ſame;
   but the image is new; for the appearance of the object is changed; it is preſented to the fancy
   in another attitude: and clothed with new circumſtances, to make it ſuit the different
   illuſtration for which it is employed. In this lies Oſſian's great art; in ſo happily varying the
   form of the few natural appearances with which he was acquainted, as to make them correſpond to a
   great many different objects.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Let</span> us take for one inſtance the moon, which is very frequently introduced
   in his compariſons; as in northern climates, where the nights are long, the moon is a greater
   object of attention than in the climate of Homer; and let us view how much our poet has
   diverſified its appearance. The ſhield of it warrior is like “the darkened moon when it moves a
   dun circle through the heavens.” The face of a ghoſt, wan and ale, is like “the beam of the
   ſetting moon.” And a different appearance of a ghoſt, thin and indiſtinct, is like “the

   when the ſky pours down its flaky ſnow, and the world is ſilent and dark;” or, in a different
   form ſtill, is like “the watery beam of the moon, when it ruſhes from between two clouds, and the
   midnight ſhower is on the field.” A very oppoſite uſe is made of the moon in the deſcription of
   Agandecca: “She came in all her beauty, like the moon from the cloud of the eaſt.” Hope ſucceeded
   by diſappointment, is “joy riſing on her face and ſorrow returning again, like a thin cloud on
   the moon.” But when Swaran, after his defeat, is cheered by Fingal's generoſity, “his face
   brightened like the full moon of heaven, when the clouds vaniſh away, and leave her calm and
   broad in the midſt of the ſky.” Venvela is “bright as the moon when it trembles o'er the weſtern
   wave;” but the ſoul of the guilty Uthal is “dark as the troubled face of the moon, when it
   foretells the ſtorm.” And by a very fanciful and uncommon alluſion, it is ſaid of Cormac, who was
   to die in his early years, “Nor long ſhalt thou lift the ſpear, mildly-ſhining beam of youth!
   Death ſtands dim behind thee, like the darkened half of the moon behind its growing light.”</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Another</span> inſtance of the ſame nature may be taken from miſt, which, as being
   a very familiar appearance in the country of Oſſian, he applies to a variety of purpoſes, and
   purſues through a great many forms. Sometimes, which one would hardly expect, he employs it to
   heighten the appearance of a beautiful object. The hair of Morna is “like the miſt of Cromla,
   when it curls on the rock, and ſhines to the beam of the weſt.” “The ſong comes with its muſic to
   melt and pleaſe the ear. It is like ſoft miſt, that riſing from the lake pours on the ſilent

   ſimilitude of ſome diſagreeable or terrible object. “The ſoul of Nathos was ſad, like the ſun in

   dim.”—“The darkneſs of old age comes like the miſt of the deſert.” The face of a ghoſt is “pale
   as the miſt of Cromla.”—“The gloom of battle is rolled along as miſt that is poured on the
   valley, when ſtorms invade the ſilent ſunſhine of heaven.” Fame, ſuddenly departing, is likened
   to “miſt that flies away before the ruſtling wind of the vale.” A ghoſt, ſlowly vaniſhing, to
   “miſt that melts by degrees on the ſunny hill.” Cairbar, after his treacherous aſſaſſination of
   Oſcar, is compared to a peſtilential fog. “I love a foe like Cathmor,” ſays Fingal, “his ſoul is
   great; his arm is ſtrong; his battles are full of fame. But the little ſoul is like a vapor that
   hovers round the marſhy lake. It never riſes on the green hill, leſt the winds meet it there. Its
   dwelling is in the cave; and it ſends forth the dart of death.” This is a ſimile highly finiſhed.
   But there is another which is ſtill more ſtriking, founded alſo on miſt, in the fourth book of
   Temora. Two factious chiefs are contending: Cathmor, the king, interpoſes, rebukes, and ſilences
   them. The poet intends to give us the higheſt idea of Cathmor's ſuperiority; and moſt effectually
   accompliſhes his intention by the following happy image. “They ſunk
   <span class="page-number-image-wrapper"><span class="page-break">

   columns of morning miſt, when the ſun riſes between them on his glittering rocks. Dark is their
   rolling on either ſide; each towards its reedy pool.” Theſe inſtances may ſufficiently ſhow with
   what richneſs of imagination Oſſian's compariſons abound, and, at the ſame time, with what
   propriety of judgment they are employed. If his field was narrow, it muſt be admitted to have
   been as well cultivated as its extent would allow.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">As</span> it is uſual to judge of poets from a compariſon of their ſimiles more
   than of other paſſages, it will, perhaps, be agreeable to the reader, to ſee how Homer and Oſſian
   have conducted ſome images of the ſame kind. This might be ſhown in many inſtances. For as the
   great objects of nature are common to the poets of all nations, and make the general ſtorehouſe
   of all imagery, the groundwork of their compariſons muſt, of courſe, be Frequently the ſame. I
   ſhall ſelect only a few of the moſt conſiderable from both poets. Mr. Pope's tranſlation of Homer
   can be of no uſe to us here. The parallel is altogether unfair between proſe and the impoſing
   harmony of flowing numbers. It is only by viewing Homer in the ſimplicity of a

   compariſon between the two bards.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſhock of two encountering armies, the noiſe and the tumult of battle,
   afford one of the moſt grand and awful ſubjects of deſcription; on which all epic poets have
   exerted their ſtrength. Let us firſt hear Homer. The following deſcription is a favourite one,
   for we find it twice repeated in the ſame words<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333554592"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>. “When now the conflicting hoſts joined in the
   field of battle, then were mutually oppoſed ſhields, and ſwords, and the ſtrength of armed men.
   The boſſy bucklers were daſhed againſt each other. The univerſal tumult roſe. There were mingled
   the triumphant ſhouts and the dying groans of the victors and the vanquiſhed. The earth ſtreamed
   with blood. As when winter torrents, ruſhing from the mountains, pour into a narrow valley their
   violent waters. They iſſue from a thouſand ſprings, and mix in the hollowed channel. The diſtant
   ſhepherd hears on the mountain their roar from afar. Such was the terror and the ſhout of the
   engaging armies.” In another paſſage, the poet, much in the manner of Oſſian, heaps ſimile on

   noiſe of the ocean, when roll the waves on high; as the laſt peal of the thunder of heaven; ſuch
   is the noiſe of battle.” “As roll a thouſand waves to the rock, ſo Swaran's beſt came on; as
   meets a rock a thouſand waves, ſo Iniſfail met Swaran. Death raiſes all his voices around, and
   mixes with the ſound of ſhields.—The field echoes from wing to wing, as a hundred hammers that
   riſe by turns on the red ſon of the furnace.”—“As a hundred winds on Morven; as the ſtreams of a
   hundred hills; as clouds fly ſucceſſive over heaven or as the dark ocean aſſaults the ſhore of
   the deſert ſo roaring, ſo vaſt, ſo terrible, the armies mixed on Lena's echoing heath.” In
   ſeveral of theſe images there is a remarkable ſimilarity to Homer's: but what follows is ſuperior
   to any compariſon that Homer uſes on this ſubject. “The groan of the people ſpread over the
   hills; it was like the thunder of night, when the cloud burſts on Cona, and a thouſand ghoſts
   ſhriek at once on the hollow wind.” Never was an image of, more awful ſublimity employed to
   heighten the terror of battle.</p>

   “beholds from the rock a cloud borne along the ſea by the weſtern wind; black as pitch it appears
   from afar ſailing over the ocean, and carrying the dreadful ſtorm. He ſhrinks at the ſight, and
   drives his flock into the cave: ſuch, under the Ajaces, moved on the dark, the thickened phalanx
   to the war.”<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333541376"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a> —“They came,” ſays Oſſian, “over the deſert like ſtormy clouds,
   when the winds roll them over the heath; their edges are tinged with lightning; and the echoing
   groves foreſee the ſtorm.” The edges of the clouds tinged with lightning, is a ſublime idea: but
   the ſhepherd and his flock render Homer's ſimile more pictureſque. This is frequently the
   difference between the two poets. Oſſian gives no more than the main image, ſtrong and full:
   Homer adds circumſtances and appendages, which amuſe the fancy by enlivening the ſcenery.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Homer</span> compares the regular appearance of an army, to “clouds that are

   its womb, and ſcatters the curling gloom on every ſide.” Oſſian's clouds aſſume a great many
   forms, and, as we might expect from his climate, are a fertile ſource of imagery to him. “The
   warriors followed their chiefs like the gathering of the rainy clouds behind the red meteors of
   heaven.” An army retreating without coming to action, is likened to “clouds, that having long
   threatened rain, retire ſlowly behind the hills.” The picture of Oithona, after ſhe had
   determined to die, is lively and delicate. “Her ſoul was reſolved, and the tear was dried from
   her wildly-looking eye. A troubled joy roſe on her mind, like the red path of the lightning on a
   ſtormy cloud.” The image alſo of the gloomy Cairbar, meditating, in ſilence, the aſſaſſination of
   Oſcar, until the moment came when his deſigns were ripe for execution, is extremely noble and
   complete in all its parts. “Cairbar heard their words in ſilence, like the cloud of a ſhower; it
   ſtands dark on Cromla till the lightning burſts its ſide. The valley gleams with red light; the
   ſpirits of the ſtorm rejoice. So ſtood the ſilent king of Temora; at length his words are
   heard.”</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Homer's</span> compariſon of Achilles to the Dog-Star, is very ſublime. “Priam
   beheld him ruſhing along the plain, ſhining in his armour, like the ſtar of autumn bright are its
   beams, diſtinguiſhed amidſt the multitude of ſtars in the dark hour of night. It riſes in its
   ſplendor; but its ſplendor is fatal; betokening to miſerable men the deſtroying heat<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333530880"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>.” The firſt appearance of Fingal is, in like manner, compared by
   Oſſian to a ſtar or meteor. “Fingal, tall in his ſhip, ſtretched his bright lance before him.
   Terrible was the gleam of his ſteel; it was like the green meteor of death, ſetting in the heath
   of Malmor, when the traveller is alone, and the broad moon is darkened in heaven.” The hero's
   appearance in Homer is more magnificent; in Oſſian, more terrible.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">A tree</span> cut down, or overthrown by a ſtorm, is a ſimilitude frequent among
   poets for deſcribing the fall of a warrior in battle. Homer employs it often. But the moſt
   beautiful, by far, of his compariſons, founded on this object, indeed one of the moſt beautiful
   in the whole Iliad, is that on the death of Euphorbus. “As the young and verdant olive, which a
   man hath reared with care in a lonely field, where

   fair and flouriſhing; it is fanned by the breath of all the winds, and loaded with white
   bloſſoms; when the ſudden blaſt of a whirlwind deſcending, roots it out from its bed, and
   ſtretches it on the duſt <a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333526048"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>.” To this, elegant as it is, we may oppoſe the following ſimile of
   Oſſian's, relating to the death of the three ſons of Uſnoth. “They fell, like three young oaks
   which ſtood alone on the hill. The traveller ſaw the lovely trees, and wondered how they grew ſo
   lonely. The blaſt of the deſert came by night, and laid their green heads low. Next day he
   returned; but they were withered, and the heath was bare.” Malvina's alluſion to the ſame object,
   in her lamentation over Oſcar, is ſo exquiſitely tender, that I cannot forbear giving it a place
   alſo. “I was a lovely tree in thy preſence, Oſcar! with all my branches round me. But thy death
   came, like a blaſt from the deſert, and laid my green head low. The ſpring returned with its
   ſhowers; but no leaf of mine aroſe.” Several of Oſſian's ſimiles, taken from trees, are
   remarkably beautiful, and diverſified with well-choſen circumſtances ſuch as that upon the death
   of Ryno and Orla: They have fallen

   acroſs a ſtream, and withers in the wind of the mountains.” Or that which Oſſian applies to
   himſelf: “I, like an ancient oak in Morven, moulder alone in my place; the blaſt hath lopped my
   branches away; and I tremble at the winds of the north.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">As</span> Homer exalts his heroes by comparing them to gods, Oſſian makes the ſame
   uſe of compariſons taken from ſpirits and ghoſts. “Swaran roared in battle, like the ſhrill
   ſpirit of a ſtorm, that ſits dim on the clouds of Gormal, and enjoys the death of the mariner.”
   His people gathered round Erragon, “like ſtorms around the ghoſt of night, when he calls them
   from the top of Morven, and prepares to pour them on the land of the ſtranger.”—“They fell before
   my ſon like groves in the deſert, when an angry ghoſt ruſhes through night, and takes their green
   heads in his hand.” In ſuch images, Oſſian appears in his ſtrength; for very ſeldom have
   ſupernatural beings been painted with ſo much ſublimity, and ſuch force of imagination, as by
   this poet. Even Homer, great as he is, muſt yield to him in ſimiles formed upon theſe. Take, for
   inſtance, the following, which is the moſt remarkable of this kind in the Iliad.

   Mars, the deſtroyer of men, when lie ruſhes to war. Terror, his beloved ſon, ſtrong and fierce,
   attends him; who fills with diſmay the moſt valiant hero. They come from Thrace armed againſt the
   Ephyrians and Phlegyans; nor do they regard the prayers of either, but diſpoſe of ſucceſs at
   their will<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333517024"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>.” The idea here is undoubtedly noble, but obſerve what a figure
   Oſſian ſets before the aſtoniſhed imagination, and with what ſublimely terrible circumſtances he
   has heightened it. “He ruſhed, in the ſound of his arms, like the dreadful ſpirit of Loda, when
   he comes in the roar of a thouſand ſtorms, and ſcatters battles from his eyes. He ſits on a cloud
   over Lochlin's ſeas. His mighty hand is on his ſword. The wind lifts his flaming locks. So
   terrible was Cuthullin in the day of his fame.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Homer's</span> compariſons relate chiefly to martial ſubjects, to the appearances
   and motions of armies, the engagement and death of heroes, and the various incidents of war. In
   Oſſian, we find a greater variety of other ſubjects, illuſtrated by ſimiles, particularly the
   ſongs of bards, the beauty of women, the different circumſtances of

   give occaſion to much beautiful imagery. What, for inſtance, can be more delicate and moving,
   than the following ſimile of Oithona's, in her lamentation over the diſhonour ſhe had ſuffered
   “Chief of Strumon.” replied the ſighing maid, why didſt thou come over the dark blue wave to
   Nuath's mournful daughter? Why did not I paſs away in ſecret, like the flower of the rock, that
   lifts its fair head unſeen, and ſtrews its withered leaves on the blaſt?” The muſic of bards, a
   favourite object with Oſſian, is illuſtrated by a variety of the moſt beautiful appearances that
   are to be found in nature. It is compared to the calm ſhower of ſpring; to the dews of the
   morning on the hill of roes; to the face of the blue and ſtill lake. Two ſimiles on this ſubject
   I ſhall quote, becauſe they would do honour to any of the moſt celebrated claſſics. The one is:
   “Sit thou on the heath, O bard! and let us hear thy voice; it is pleaſant as the gale of the
   ſpring that ſighs on the hunter's ear, when he awakens from dreams of joy, and has heard the
   muſic of the ſpirits of the hill.” The other contains a ſhort but exquiſitely tender image,
   accompanied with the fineſt poetical painting. “The muſic of Carril was like the memory of joys
   that are paſt,

The
   ghoſts of departed bards heard it from Slimora's ſide. Soft ſounds ſpread along the wood; and the
   ſilent valleys of night rejoice.” What a figure would ſuch imagery and ſuch ſcenery have made,
   had they been preſented to us adorned with the ſweetneſs and harmony of the Virgilian
   numbers!</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">I have</span> choſen all along to compare Oſſian with Homer, rather than Virgil,
   for an obvious reaſon. There is a much nearer correſpondence between the times and manners of the
   two former poets. Both wrote in an early period of ſociety; both are originals; both are
   diſtinguiſhed by ſimplicity, ſublimity, and fire. The correct elegances of Virgil, his artful
   imitation of Homer, the Roman ſtatelineſs which he everywhere maintains, admit no parallel with
   the abrupt boldneſs and enthuſiaſtic warmth of the Celtic bard. In one article, indeed, there is
   a reſemblance. Virgil is more tender than Homer, and thereby agrees more with Oſſian; with this
   difference, that the feelings of the one are more gentle and poliſhed—thoſe of the other more
   ſtrong: the tenderneſs of Virgil ſoftenſ—that of Oſſian diſſolves and overcomes the heart.</p>

   and climate altogether different from thoſe of Oſſian: a warmer country, a more ſmiling face of
   nature, the arts of agriculture and of rural life much farther advanced. The wine-preſs and the
   threſhing-floor are often preſented to us; the cedar and the palm-tree, the fragrance of perfumes
   the voice of the turtle, and the beds of lilies. The ſimiles are, like Oſſian's, generally ſhort,
   touching on one point of reſemblance, rather than ſpread out into little epiſodes. In the
   following example may be perceived what inexpreſſible grandeur poetry receives from the
   intervention of the Deity. “The nations ſhall ruſh like the ruſhing of many waters; but God ſhall
   rebuke them, and they ſhall fly far off, and ſhall be chaſed as the chaff of the “mountains

  <p class="noindent"> <span class="sc">Beſides</span> formal compariſons, the poetry of Oſſian is embelliſhed with many

   the light of beauty; but her heart was the houſe of pride.” This mode of expreſſion, which
   ſuppreſſes the mark of compariſon, and ſubſtitutes a figured deſcription in room of the object
   deſcribed, is a great enlivener of ſtyle. It denotes that glow and rapidity of fancy, which,
   without pauſing to form a regular ſimile, paints the object at one ſtroke. “Thou art to me the
   beam of the caſt, riſing in a land unknown.”—“In peace, thou art the gale of ſpring; In war, the
   mountain ſtorm.”—“Pleaſant be thy reſt, O lovely beam! ſoon haſt thou ſet on our hills! The ſteps
   of thy departure were ſtately, like the moon on the blue trembling wave. But thou haſt left us in
   darkneſs, firſt of the maids of Lutha!—Soon haſt thou ſet, Malvina! but thou riſeſt, like the
   beam of the eaſt, among the ſpirits of thy friends, where they ſit in their ſtormy halls, the
   chambers of the thunder.” This is correct, and finely ſupported. But in the following inſtance,
   the metaphor, though very beautiful at the beginning, becomes imperfect before it cloſes, by
   being improperly mixed with the literal ſenſe. “Trathal went forth with the ſtream of his people:
   but they met a rock; Fingal ſtood unmoved; broken, they rolled back from his

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> hyperbole is a figure which we might expect to find often employed by
   Oſſian; as the undiſciplined imagination of early ages generally prompts exaggeration, and
   carries its objects to exceſs; whereas longer experience, and farther progreſs in the arts of
   life, chaſten men's ideas and expreſſions. Yet Oſſian's hyperboles appear not, to me, either ſo
   frequent or ſo harſh as might at firſt have been looked for; an advantage owing, no doubt, to the
   more cultivated ſtate in which, as was before ſhown, poetry ſubſiſted among the ancient Celtæ,
   than among moſt other barbarous nations. One of the moſt exaggerated deſcriptions in the whole
   work, is what meets us at the beginning of Fingal, where the ſcout makes his report to Cuthullin
   of the landing of the foe. But this is ſo far from deſerving cenſure, that it merits praiſe, as
   being on that occaſion natural and proper. The ſcout arrives, trembling and full of fears; and it
   is well known that no paſſion diſpoſes men to hyperbolize more than terror. It both annihilates
   themſelves in their own apprehenſion, and magnifies every object which they view through the
   medium of a troubled imagination. Hence all thoſe indiſtinct images of formidable

   Witneſs the apoſtrophe, in the firſt book of Fingal, to the maid of Iniſtore, whoſe lover had

   her as, at that moment, really in this ſituation, he becomes afraid of the harm ſhe may receive
   from the inclemency of the night; and with an enthuſiaſm happy and affecting, though beyond the
   cautious ſtrain of modern poetry, “Retire,” he proceeds, “retire, for it is night, my love, and

   The beauties of each are too great and too obvious to need any particular comment. In one paſſage
   only of the addreſs to the moon, there appears ſome obſcurity. “Whither doſt thou retire from thy
   courſe when the darkneſs of they countenance grows? Haſt thou thy hall like Oſſian? Dwelleſt thou
   in the ſhadow of grief? Have thy ſiſters fallen from heaven? Are they who rejoiced with thee, at
   night, no more? Yes, they have fallen, fair light! and thou doſt often retire to mourn.” We may
   be at a loſs to comprehend, at firſt view, the ground of thoſe ſpeculations of Oſſian concerning
   the moon: but when all the circumſtances are attended to, they will appear to flow naturally from
   the preſent ſituation of his mind.

   paſſion, tinctures with its own diſpoſition every object which it beholds. The old bard, with his
   heart bleeding for the loſs of all his friends, is meditating on the different phaſes of the
   moon. Her waning and darkneſs preſent to his melancholy imagination the image of ſorrow; and
   preſently the idea ariſes, and is indulged, that like himſelf, ſhe retires to mourn over the loſs
   of other moons, or of ſtars, whom he calls her ſiſters, and fancies to have once rejoiced with
   her at night, now fallen from heaven. Darkneſs ſuggeſted the idea of mourning, and mourning
   ſuggeſted nothing ſo naturally to Oſſian as the death of beloved friends. An inſtance preciſely
   ſimilar, of this influence of paſſion, may be ſeen in a paſſage, which has always been admired,
   of Shakſpeare's King Lear. The old man, on the point of diſtraction through the inhumanity of his

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Having</span> now treated fully of Oſſian's talents, with reſpect to deſcription
   and imagery, it only remains to make ſome obſervations on his ſentiments. No ſentiments can be
   beautiful without being proper; that is, ſuited to the character and ſituation of thoſe who utter
   them. In this reſpect Oſſian is as correct as moſt writers. His characters, as above deſcribed,
   are, in general, well ſupported; which could not have been the caſe, had the ſentiments been
   unnatural or out of place. A variety of perſonages, of different ages, ſexes, and conditions, are
   introduced into his poems; and they ſpeak and act with a propriety of ſentiment and behavior

   is the higheſt effect either of eloquence or poetry; and, to produce this effect, requires a
   genius glowing with the ſtrongeſt and warmeſt conception of ſome object, awful, great, or
   magnificent. That this character of genius belongs to Oſſian, may, I think, ſufficiently appear
   from many of the paſſages I have already had occaſion to quote. To produce more inſtances were
   ſuperfluous. If the engagement of Fingal with the ſpirit of Loda, in Carric-thura; if the
   encounters of the armies, in Fingal; if the addreſs to the ſun, in Carthon; if the ſimiles

   ſentiment is preſented to it in its native form. But no ſooner does the poet attempt to ſpread
   out this ſentiment, or deſcription, and to deck it round and round with glittering ornaments,
   than the mind begins to fall from its high elevation; the tranſport is over; the beautiful may
   remain, but the ſublime is gone. Hence the conciſe and ſimple ſtyle of Oſſian gives great
   advantage to his ſublime conceptions, and aſſiſts them in ſeizing the imagination with full

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Sublimity</span>, as belonging to ſentiment, coincides, in a great meaſure, with
   magnanimity, heroiſm, and generoſity of ſentiment. Whatever diſcovers human nature in its
   greateſt elevation; whatever beſpeaks a high effort of ſoul, or ſhews a mind ſuperior to
   pleaſures, to dangers, and to death, forms what may be called the moral of ſentimental ſublime.
   For this Oſſian is eminently diſtinguiſhed. No poet maintains a higher tone of virtuous and noble
   ſentiment throughout all his works. Particularly in all the ſentiments of Fingal there is a
   grandeur and loftineſs, proper to ſwell the mind with the higheſt ideas of human perfection.
   Wherever he appears, we behold the hero. The objects which he purſues are always truly great: to
   bend the proud; to protect the injured; to defend his friends; to overcome his enemies by
   generoſity more than by force. A portion of the ſame ſpirit actuates all the other heroes. Valor
   reigns; but it is a generous valor, void of cruelty, animated by honour, not by hatred. We behold

   avarice or of inſult; but a perpetual contention for fame; a deſire of being diſtinguiſhed and
   remembered for gallant actions; a love of juſtice; and a zealous attachment to their friends and
   their country. Such is the ſtrain of ſentiment in the works of Oſſian.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> the ſublimity of moral ſentiments, if they wanted the ſoftening of the
   tender, would be in hazard of giving a hard and ſtiff air to poetry. It is not enough to admire.
   Admiration is a cold feeling, in compariſon of that deep intereſt which the heart takes in tender
   and pathetic ſcenes; where, by a myſterious attachment to the objects of compaſſion, we are
   pleaſed and delighted, even whilſt we mourn. With ſcenes of this kind Oſſian abounds; and his
   high merit in theſe is inconteſtible. He may be blamed for drawing tears too often from our eyes;
   but that he has the power of commanding them, I believe no man, who as the leaſt ſenſibility,
   will queſtion. The general character of his poetry is the heroic mixed with the elegiac ſtrain;
   admiration tempered with pity. Ever fond of giving, as he expreſſes it, “the joy of grief,” it is
   viſible that, on all moving ſubjects, he delights to exert his genius; and, accordingly, never

   preſent. His great art in managing them lies in giving vent to the ſimple and natural emotions of
   the heart. We meet with no exaggerated declamation; no ſubtile refinements on ſorrow; no
   ſubſtitution of deſcription in place of paſſion. Oſſian felt ſtrongly himſelf; and the heart,
   when uttering its native language, never fails, by powerful ſympathy, to affect the heart. A
   great variety of examples might be produced. We need only open the book to find them everywhere.
   What, for inſtance, can be more moving than the lamentations of Oithona, after her miſfortune?
   Gaul, the ſon of Morni, her lover, ignorant of what ſhe had ſuffered, comes to her reſcue. Their

   over, then be thy voice ſweet in his ear, to praiſe the king of ſwords. Give him the ſword of
   Caithbat; for Cuthullin is worthy no more to lift the arms of his fathers. But, O ye ghoſts of
   the lonely Cromla! ye ſouls of chiefs that are no more! be ye the companions of Cuthullin, and
   talk to him in the cave of his ſorrow. For never more ſhall I be renowned among the mighty in the
   land. I am like a beam that has ſhone: like a miſt that has fled away; when the blaſt of the
   morning came, and brightened the ſhaggy ſide of the hill. Connal! talk of arms no more: departed
   is my fame. My ſighs ſhall be on Cromla's wind; till my footſteps ceaſe to be ſeen. And thou,
   white-boſomed Bragela! mourn over the fall of my fame: for vanquiſhed, I will never return to
   thee, thou ſunbeam of Dunſcaich!” </p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Beſides</span> ſuch extended pathetic ſcenes, Oſſian frequently pierces the heart
   by a ſingle unexpected ſtroke. When Oſcar fell in battle, “No father mourned his ſon ſlain in
   youth; no brother, his brother of love; they fell without tears, for the chief of the people was
   low.” In the admirable interview of Hector with Andromache, in the ſixth Iliad, the circumſtance
   of the child in his nurſe's arms, has often been remarked as adding much to the tenderneſs of the
   ſcene. In the following paſſage, relating to the death of Cuthullin, we find a circumſtance that
   muſt ſtrike the imagination with ſtill greater force. “And is the ſon of Semo fallen?” ſaid
   Carril, with a ſigh. “Mournful are Tura's walls, and ſorrow dwells at Dunſcaich. Thy ſpouſe is
   left alone in her youth; the ſon of thy love is alone. He ſhall come to Bragela, and aſk her why
   ſhe weeps? He ſhall lift his eyes to the wall, and ſee his father's ſword. Whoſe ſword is that?
   he will ſay; and the ſoul of his mother is ſad.” Soon after Fingal had ſhown all the grief of a
   father's heart for Ryno, one of his ſons, fallen in battle, he is calling, after his accuſtomed
   manner, his ſons to the chaſe. “Call,” ſays he, “Fillan and Ryno.—But he is not here.—My ſon
   reſts on the bed

   is worthy of the higheſt tragic poet. <span class="quote">
   <span class="line">If ſhe come in, ſhe'll ſure ſpeak to my wife—</span>
   <span class="line">My wife!—my wife!—What wife!—I have no wife—</span>
   <span class="line">Oh, inſupportable! Oh, heavy hour! </span> <dt><i>Othello</i>, Act 5. Scene
   7.</dt></span> </p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> contrivance of the incident in both poets is ſimilar: but the
   circumſtances are varied with judgment. Othello dwells upon the name of wife, when it had fallen
   from him, with the confuſion and horror of one tortured with guilt. Fingal, with the dignity of a
   hero, corrects himſelf, and ſuppreſſes his riſing grief. </p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> contraſt which Oſſian frequently makes between his preſent and his
   former ſtate, diffuſes over his whole poetry a ſolemn pathetic air, which cannot fail to make
   impreſſion on every heart. The concluſion of the ſongs of Selma is particularly calculated for
   this purpoſe. Nothing can be more poetical and tender, or can leave upon the mind a ſtronger and
   more affecting idea of the venerable and aged bard. “Such were the words of the bards in the days
   of the ſong; when the king heard the muſic of harps, and the tales of other times. The chiefs
   gathered from all their

They
   praiſed the voice of Cona <a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333399920"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>; the firſt among a thouſand
   bards. But age is now on my tongue, and my ſoul has failed. I hear, ſometimes, the ghoſts of
   bards, and learn their pleaſant ſong. But memory fails on my mind; I hear the call of years. They
   ſay, as they paſs along, Why does Oſſian ſing? Soon ſhall he lie in the narrow houſe, and no bard
   ſhall raiſe his fame. Roll on, ye dark-brown years! for ye bring no joy in your courſe. Let the
   tomb open to Oſſian, for his ſtrength has failed. The ſons of the ſong are gone to reſt. My voice
   remains, like a blaſt, that roars lonely on the ſea-rur-rounded rock, after the winds are laid.
   The dark moſs whiſtles there, and the diſtant mariner ſees the waving trees.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Upon</span> the whole, if to feel ſtrongly, and to deſcribe naturally, be the two
   chief ingredients in poetical genius, Oſſian muſt, after fair examination, be held to poſſeſs
   that genius in a high degree. The queſtion is not, whether a few improprieties may be pointed out
   in his works?-whether this or that paſſage might not have been worked up with more art and ſkill,
   by ſome writer of happier times? A thouſand ſuch

   indeciſive as to his genuine merit. But has he the ſpirit, the fire the inſpiration of a poet?
   Does he utter the voice of nature? Does he elevate by his ſentiments? Does lie intereſt by his
   deſcription? Does be paint to the heart as well as to the fancy? Does he make his readers glow,
   and tremble, and weep? Theſe are the great characteriſtics of true poetry. Where theſe are found,
   he muſt be a minute critic, indeed, who can dwell, upon ſlight defects. A few beauties of this
   high kind tranſcend whole volumes of faultleſs mediocrity. Uncouth and abrupt Oſſian may
   ſometimes appear, by reaſon of his conciſeneſs; but he is ſublime, he is pathetic, in an eminent
   degree. If he has not the extenſive knowledge, the regular dignity of narration, the fulneſs and
   accuracy of deſcription, which we find in Homer and Virgil, yet in ſtrength of imagination, in
   grandeur of ſentiment, in native majeſty of paſſion, he is fully their equal. If he flows not
   always like a clear ſtream, yet he breaks forth often like a torrent of fire. Of art, too, he is
   far from being deſtitute; and his imagination is remarkable for delicacy as well as ſtrength.
   Seldom or never is he either trifling or tedious; and if he be thought too melancholy, yet he is
   always

Though his merit were in other
   reſpects much leſs than it is, this alone ought to entitle him to high regard, that his writings
   are remarkably favourable to virtue. They awake the tendereſt ſympathies, and inſpire the moſt
   generous emotions. No reader can riſe from him without being warmed with the ſentiments of
   humanity, virtue, and honour.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Though</span> unacquainted with the original language, there is no one but muſt
   judge the tranſlation to deſerve the higheſt praiſe, on account of its beauty and elegance. Of
   its faithfulneſs and accuracy, I have been aſſured by perſons ſkilled in the Gaelic tongue, who
   from their youth were acquainted with many of theſe poems of Oſſian. To tranſfuſe ſuch ſpirited
   and fervid ideas from one language into another; to tranſlate literally, and yet with ſuch a glow
   of poetry; to keep alive ſo much paſſion, and ſupport ſo much dignity throughout; is one of the
   moſt difficult works of genius, and proves the tranſlator to have been animated with no ſmall
   portion of Oſſian's ſpirit.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> meaſured proſe which he has employed, poſſeſſes conſiderable advantages
   above any ſort of verſification he could have choſen. While it pleaſes and fills the ear with a
   variety of harmonious cadences, being, at the ſame time,

   arrangement of words, it allows the ſpirit of the original to be exhibited, with more juſtneſs,
   force, and ſimplicity. Elegant, however, and maſterly, as Mr. Macpherſon's tranſlation is, we
   muſt never forget, whilſt we read it, that we are putting the merit of the original to a ſevere
   teſt. For we are examining a poet ſtripped of his native dreſs; diveſted of the harmony of his
   own numbers. We know how much grace and energy the works of the Greek and Latin poets receive
   from the charm of verſification in their original languages. If then, deſtitute of this
   advantage, exhibited in a literal verſion, Oſſian ſtill has power to pleaſe as a poet; and not to
   pleaſe only, but often to command, to tranſport, to melt the heart; we may very ſafely infer that
   his productions are the off-ſpring of a true and uncommon genius; and we may proudly aſſign him a
   place among thoſe whoſe works are to laſt for ages.</p>

   <h3 class="normal">ARGUMENT to <span class="sc">Book</span> I.</h3>
   <p class="noindent"> Cairbar, the ſon of Borbar-duthul, lord of Atha in Connaught the moſt potent chief of the
   race of the Firbolg, having murdered, at Temora the royal palace, Cormac the ſon of Artho, the
   young king of Ireland, uſurped the throne. Cormac was lineally deſcended from Conar the ſon of
   Trenmor, the great grandfather of Fingal, king of thoſe Caledonians who inhabited the weſtern
   coaſt of Scotland. Fingal reſented the behaviour of Cairbar, and reſolved to paſs over into
   Ireland, with an army, to re-eſtabliſh the royal family on the Iriſh throne. Early intelligence
   of his deſigns coming to Cairbar, he aſſembled ſome of his tribes in Ulſter, and at the ſame time
   ordered his brother Cathmor to follow him ſpeedily with an army, from Temora. Such was the
   ſituation of affairs when the Caledonian invaders appeared on the coaſt of Ulſter.</p>
   <p class="noindent">The poem opens in the morning. Cairbar is repreſented as retired from the reſt of the army,
   when one of his ſcouts brought him news of the landing of Fingal. He aſſembles a council of his
   chiefs. Foldath the chief of Morna haughtily deſpiſes the enemy ; and is reprimanded warmly by
   Malthos. Cairbar, after hearing their debate, orders a feaſt to be prepared, to which, by his
   bard Olla, he invites Oſcar the ſon of Oſſian ; reſolving to pick a quarrel with that hero, and
   ſo have ſome pretext for killing him. Oſcar came to the feaſt; the quarrel happened ; the
   followers of both fought, and Cairbar and Oſcar fell by mutual wounds. The noiſe of the battle
   reached Fingal's army. The king came on, to the relief of Oſcar, and the Iriſh fell back to the
   army of Cathmor, who was advanced to the banks of the river Lubar, on the heath of Moilena.
   Fingal, after mourning over his grandſon, ordered Ullin the chief of his bards to carry his body
   to Morven, to be there interred. Night coming on, Althan, the ſon of Conachar, relates to the
   king the particulars of the murder of Cormac. Fillan, the ſon of Fingal, is ſent to obſerve the
   motions of Cathmar by night, which concludes the action of the firſt day. The ſcene of this book
   is a plain, near the hill of Mora, which roſe on the borders of the heath of Moilena, in Ulſter. </p>

  <p class="noindent"> <span class="sc">The</span> blue waves of Erin roll in light. The mountains are covered with day.
   Trees ſhake their duſky heads, in the breeze. Grey torrents pour their noiſy ſtreams. Two green
   hills, with aged oaks, ſurround a narrow plain. The blue courſe of a ſtream is there. On its
   banks ſtood Cairbar<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753336193856"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a> of Atha. His ſpear ſupports the king : the red eye of his fear is ſad. Cormac riſes in

    The grey form of the youth appears in darkneſs. Blood pours from
   his airy ſide. Cairbar thrice threw his ſpear on earth. Thrice he ſtroaked his beard. His ſteps
   are ſhort. He often ſtops. He toſſes his ſinewy arms. He is like a cloud in the deſart, varying
   its form to every blaſt. The valleys are ſad around, and fear, by turns, the ſhower ! The king,
   at length, reſumed his ſoul. He took his pointed ſpear, He turned his eye to Moi-lena, The ſcouts
   of blue ocean came. They came with ſteps of fear, and often looked behind. Cairbar knew that the
   mighty were near ! He called his gloomy chiefs.</p>

 <h3 class="normal">TEMORA: AN EPIC POEM. BOOK II.</h3>
 
  <h3 class="normal">ARGUMENT to Book II.</h3>
  <p class="noindent"> This book opens, we may ſuppoſe, about midnight, with a ſoliloquy of Oſſian, who had retired,
   from the reſt of the army, to mourn for his ſon Oſcar. Upon hearing the noiſe of Cathmor's army
   approaching, he went to find out his brother Fillan, who kept the watch, on the hill of Mora, in
   the front of Fingal's army. In the converſation of the brothers, the epiſode of Conar, the ſon of
   Trenmor, who was the firſt king of Ireland, is introduced, which lays open the origin of the
   conteſts between the Cael and Firbolg, the two nations who firſt poſſeſſed themſelves of that
   iſland. Oſſian kindles a fire on Mora ; upon which Cathmor deſiſted from the deſign he had formed
   of ſurpriſing the army of the Caledonians. He calls a council of his chiefs; reprimands Foldath
   for adviſing a night-attack, as the Iriſh army were ſo much ſuperior in number to the enemy. The
   bard Fonar introduces the ſtory of Crothar, the anceſtor of the king, which throws further light
   on the hiſtory of Ireland, and the original pretenſions of the family of Atha, to the throne of
   that kingdom. The Iriſh chiefs lie down to reſt, and Cathmor himſelf undertakes the watch. In his
   circuit, round the army, he is met by Oſſian. The interview of the two heroes is deſcribed.
   Cathmor obtains a promiſe from Oſſian, to order a funeral elegy to be ſung over the grave of
   Cairbar; it being the opinion of the times, that the ſouls of the dead could not be happy, till
   their elegies were ſung by a bard. Morning comes. Cathmor and Oſſian part; and the latter,
   caſually meeting with Carril the ſon of Kinſena, ſends that bard, with a funeral ſong, to the
   tomb of Cairbar. </p>

  <p class="noindent"> <span class="sc">Morning</span> coming on, Fingal, after a ſpeech to his people, devolves the
   command on Gaul, the ſon of Morni ; it being the cuſtom of the times, that the king ſhould not
   engage, till the neceſſity of affairs required his ſuperior valour and conduct. The king and
   Oſſian retire to the rock of Cormul, which overlooked the field of battle. The bards ſing the
   war-ſong. The general conflict is deſcribed. Gaul, the ſon of Morni, diſtinguiſhes himſelf ;
   kills Tur-lathon, chief of Moruth, and other chiefs of leſſer name. On the other hand, Foldath,
   who commanded the Iriſh army (for Cathmor, after the example of Fingal, kept himſelf from battle)
   fights gallantly ; kills Connal, chief of Dun-lora, and advances to engage Gaul himſelf. Gaul, in
   the mean time, being wounded in the hand, by a random arrow, is covered by Fillan, the ſon of
   Fingal, who performs prodigies of valour. Night comes on. The horn of Fingal recalls his army.
   The bards meet them, with a congratulatory ſong, in which the praiſes of Gaul and Fillan are
   particularly celebrated. The chiefs ſit down at a feaſt; Fingal miſſes Connal. The epiſode of
   Connal and Duthcaron is introduced ; which throws further light on the ancient hiſtory of
   Ireland. Carril is diſpatched to raiſe the tomb of Connal. The action of this book takes up the
   ſecond day, from the opening of the poem. </p>

  <p class="noindent"> <span class="sc">The</span> ſecond night continues. Fingal relates, at the feaſt, his own firſt
   expedition into Ireland, and his marriage with Ros-crána, the daughter of Cormac, king of that
   iſland. The Iriſh chiefs convene in the preſence of Cathmor. The ſituation of the king deſcribed.
   The ſtory of Sul-mala, the daughter of Conmor, king of Inis-huna, who, in the diſguiſe of a young
   warrior, had followed Cathmor to the war. The ſullen behaviour of Foldath, who had commanded in
   the battle of the preceding day, renews the difference between him and Malthos; but Cathmor,
   interpoſing, ends it. The chiefs feaſt, and hear the ſong of Fonar the bard. Cathmor returns to
   reſt, at a diſtance from the army. The ghoſt of his brother Cairbar appears to him in a dream;
   and obſcurely foretels the iſſue of the war. The ſoliloquy of the king. He diſcovers Sul-malla.
   Morning comes. Her ſoliloquy cloſes the book. </p>

   on either ſide of the river Lubar. Fingal gives the command to Fillan ; but, at the ſame time,
   orders Gaul, the ſon of Morni, who had been wounded in the hand in the preceding battle, to
   aſſiſt him with his counſel. The army of the Fir-bolg is commanded by Foldath. The general onſet
   is deſcribed. The great actions of Fillan. He kills Rothmar and Culmin. But when Fillan conquers,
   in one wing, Foldath preſſes hard on the other. He wounds Dermid, the ſon of Duthno, and puts the
   whole wing to flight. Dermid deliberates with himſelf, and, at laſt, reſolves to put a ſtop to
   the progreſs of Foldath, by engaging him in ſingle combat. When the two chiefs were approaching
   towards one another, Fillan came ſuddenly to the relief of Dermid ; engaged Foldath, and killed
   him. The behaviour of Malthos towards the fallen Foldath. Fillan puts the whole army of the
   Fir-bolg to flight. The book cloſes with an addreſs to Clatho, the mother of that hero. </p>

  <h3 class="normal">ARGUMENT to Book VI.</h3>
  <p class="noindent"> <span class="sc">This</span> book opens with a ſpeech of Fingal, who ſees Cathmor deſcending to the
   aſſiſtance of his flying army. The king diſpatches Oſſian to the relief of Fillan. He himſelf
   retires behind the rock of Cormul, to avoid the ſight of the engagement between his ſon and
   Cathmor. Oſſian advances. The deſcent of Cathmor deſcribed. He rallies the army, renews the
   battle, and, before Oſſian could arrive, engages Fillan himſelf. Upon the approach of Oſſian, the
   combat between the two heroes ceaſes. Oſſian and Cathmor prepare to fight, but night coming on
   prevents them. Oſſian returns to the place where Cathmor and Fillan fought. He finds Fillan
   mortally wounded, and leaning againſt a rock. Their diſcourſe. Fillan dies: his body is laid, by
   Oſſian, in a neighbouring cave. The Caledonian army return to Fingal. He queſtions them about his
   ſon, and, underſtanding that he was killed, retires, in ſilence, to the rock of Cormul. Upon the
   retreat of the army of Fingal, the Fir-bolg advance. Cathmor finds Bran, one of the dogs of
   Fingal, lying on the ſhield of Fillan, before the entrance of the cave, where the body of that
   hero lay. His reflections thereupon. He returns, in a melancholy mood, to his army. Malthos
   endeavours to comfort him, by the example of his father Borbar-duthal. Cathmor retires to reſt.
   The ſong of Sul-malla concludes the book, which ends about the middle of the third night, from
   the opening of the poem. </p>

  <h3 class="normal">ARGUMENT to Book VIII.</h3>
  <p class="noindent"> The fourth morning, from the opening of the poem, comes on. Fingal, ſtill continuing in the
   place, to which he had retired on the preceding night, is ſeen, at intervals, thro' the miſt,
   which covered the rock of Cormul. The deſcent of the king is deſcribed. He orders Gaul, Dermid,
   and Carril the bard, to go to the valley of Cluna, and conduct, from thence, to the Caledonian
   army, Ferad-artho, the ſon of Cairbre, the only perſon remaining of the family of Conar, the
   firſt king of Ireland. The king takes the command of the army, and prepares for battle. Marching
   towards the enemy, he comes to the cave of Lubar, where the body of Fillan lay. Upon ſeeing his
   dog Bran, who lay at the entrance of the cave, his grief returns. Cathmor arranges the Iriſh army
   in order of battle. The appearance of that hero. The general conflict is deſcribed. The actions
   of Fingal and Cathmor. A ſtorm. The total rout of the Firbolg. The two kings engage, in a column
   of miſt, on the banks of Lubar. Their attitude and conference after the combat. The death of
   Cathmor. Fingal reſigns <i>the ſpear of Trenmor</i> to Oſſian. The ceremonies obſerved on that

  <h3 class="normal">TEMORA: AN EPIC POEM. BOOK VIII.</h3>
  <p class="noindent"> <span class="sc">As</span> when the wintry winds have ſeized the waves of the mountain-lake, have
   ſeized them, in ſtormy night, and cloathed them over with ice; white, to the hunter's early eye,
   the billows ſtill ſeem to roll. He turns his ear to the ſound of each unequal ridge. But each is
   ſilent, gleaming, ſtrewn with boughs and tufts of graſs, which ſhake and whiſtle to the wind,
   over their grey ſeats of froſt. So ſilent ſhone to the morning the ridges of Morven's hoſt, as
   each warrior looked up from his helmet towards the hill of the king; the cloud-covered hill of
   Fingal, where he ſtrode, in the folds of miſt. At times is the hero ſeen, greatly dim in all his
   arms.

    From thought to thought rolled the war, along his mighty

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Now</span> is the coming forth of the king. Firſt appeared the ſword of Luno; the
   ſpear half iſſuing from a cloud, the ſhield ſtill dim in miſt. But when the ſtride of the king
   came abroad, with all his grey, dewy locks in the wind ; then roſe the ſhouts of his hoſt over
   every moving tribe. They gathered, gleaming, round, with all their ecchoing ſhields. So riſe the
   green ſeas round a ſpirit, that comes down from the ſqually wind. The traveller hears the ſound
   afar, and lifts his head over the rock. He looks on the troubled bay, and thinks he dimly ſees
   the form. The waves ſport, unwieldy, round, with all their backs of foam.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Far-distant</span> ſtood the ſon of Morni, Duthno's race, and Cona's bard. We ſtood
   far-diſtant ; each beneath his tree. We ſhunned the eyes of the king; we had not conquered in the
   field. A little ſtream rolled at my feet: I touched its light wave, with my ſpear. I touched it
   with my ſpear; nor there was the ſoul of Oſſian. It darkly roſe, from thought to thought, and

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Loud</span>, from moſs-covered Mora, poured down, at once, the broad-winged war.
   Fingal led his people forth, king of Morven of ſtreams. On high ſpreads the eagle's wing. His

   and ſaw behind, the wide-gleaming rolling of armour. A rock he ſeemed, grey over with ice, whoſe
   woods are high in wind. Bright ſtreams leap from its head, and ſpread their foam on blaſts.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Now</span> he came to Lubar's cave, where Fillan darkly ſlept. Bran ſtill lay on
   the broken ſhield : the eagle-wing is ſtrewed by the winds. Bright, from withered furze, looked

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Nor</span> Erin heard, with fear, the ſound : wide they came rolling along. Dark
   Malthos, in the wing of war, looks forward from ſhaggy brows. Next roſe that beam of light

   <p class="noindent"> Conlath was the youngeſt of Morni's ſons, and brother to the celebrated Gaul. He was in love
    with Cuthóna the daughter of Rumar, when Toſcar the ſon of Kinfena, accompanied by Fercuth his
    friend, arrived, from Ireland, at Mora, where Conlath dwelt. He was hoſpitably received, and
    according to the cuſtom of the times, feaſted, three days, with Conlath. On the fourth he ſet
    ſail, and coaſting the <i>iſland of waves</i>, one of the Hebrides, he ſaw Cuthona hunting,
    fell in love with her, and carried her away, by force, in his ſhip. He was forced, by ſtreſs of
    weather, into I-thona a deſart iſle. In the mean-time Conlath, hearing of the rape, ſailed after
    him, and found him on the point of ſailing for the coaſt of Ireland. They fought; and they and
    their followers fell by mutual wounds. Cuthona did not long ſurvive: for ſhe died of grief the
    third day after. Fingal, hearing of their unfortunate death, ſent Stormal the ſon of Moran to
    bury them, but forgot to ſend a bard to ſing the funeral ſong over their tombs. The ghoſt of
    Conlath comes, long after, to Oſſian, to intreat him to tranſmit, to poſterity, his and
    Cuthona's fame. For it was the opinion of the times, that the ſouls of the deceaſed were not
    happy, till their elegies were compoſed by a bard. </p>

   <h3 class="normal">ARGUMENT.</h3>
   <p class="noindent"> Fingal in his voyage to Lochlin, whither he had been invited by Starno the father of
    Agandecca, touched at Berrathon, an iſland of Scandinavia, where he was kindly entertained by
    Larthmor the petty king of the place, who was a vaſſal of the ſupreme kings of Lochlin. The
    hoſpitality of Larthmor gained him Fingal's friendſhip, which that hero manifeſted, after the
    impriſonment of Larthmor by his own ſon, by ſending Oſſian and Toſcar, the father of Malvina ſo
    often mentioned, to reſcue Larthmor, and to puniſh the unnatural behaviour of Uthal. Uthal was
    handſome, and, by the ladies, much admired. Nina-thoma, the beautiful daughter of Torthoma, a
    neighbouring prince, fell in love and fled with him. He proved unconſtant; for another lady,
    whoſe name is not mentioned, gaining his affections, he confined Nina-thoma to a deſart iſland
    near the coaſt of Berrathon. She was relieved by Oſſian, who, in company with Toſcar, landing on
    Berrathon, defeated the forces of Uthal, and killed him in a ſingle combat. Nina-thoma, whoſe
    love not all the bad behaviour of Uthal could eraſe, hearing of his death, died of grief. In the
    mean time Larthmor is reſtored, and Oſſian and Toſcar return in triumph to Fingal,</p>
   <p class="noindent">The poem opens with an elegy on the death of Malvina the daughter of Toſcar, and cloſes with
    preſages of Oſſian's death. </p>

   Silent joy brightened in her face; as when the ſhadows fly from the field of ſpring ; the
   blue-ſtream is rolling in brightneſs, and the green buſh bends over its courſe !</p>

   of ſtates and kingdoms is as deſtitute of great events, as of the means of tranſmitting them to
   poſterity: The arts of poliſhed life, by which alone facts can be preſerved with certainty, are
   the production of a well-formed community. It is then hiſtorians begin to write, and public

    enjoyed long this extraordinary privilege among the
   Celtic nations who lay beyond the pale of the Roman empire. It was in the beginning of the ſecond
   century that their power among the Caledonians begun to decline. The traditions concerning
   Trathal and Cormac, anceſtors to Fingal, are full of the particulars of the fall of the Druids: a
   fingular fate, it muſt be owned, of prieſts, who had once eſtabliſhed their ſuperſtition !</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> continual wars of the Caledonians againſt the Romans hindered the better
   ſort from initiating themſelves, as the cuſtom formerly was, into the order of the Druids. The
   precepts of their religion were confined to a few, and were not much attended to by a people
   inured to war. The Vergobretus, or chief magiſtrate, was choſen without the concurrence of the
   hierarchy, or continued in his office againſt their will. Continual power ſtrengthened his
   intereſt among the tribes, and enabled him to ſend down, as hereditary to his poſterity, the
   office he had only received himſelf by election.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">On</span> occaſion of a new war againſt the <i>King of the World</i>, as

    them, came to the grandfather of the celebrated Fingal, who was then
   Vergobretus, and commanded him, in the name of the whole order, to lay down his office. Upon his
   refuſal, a civil war commenced, which ſoon ended in almoſt the total extinction of the religious
   order of the Druids. A few that remained, retired to the dark receſſes of their groves, and the
   caves they had formerly uſed for their meditations. It is then we find them in <i>the circle of
   ſtones</i>, and unheeded by the world. A total diſregard for the order, and utter abhorrence of
   the Druidical rites enſued. Under this cloud of public hate, all that had any knowlege of the
   religion of the Druids became extinct, and the nation fell into the laft degree of ignorance of
   their rites and ceremonies.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">It</span> is no matter of wonder then, that Fingal and his ſon Oſſian diſliked the
   Druids, who were the declared enemies to their ſucceſſion in the ſupreme magiſtracy. It is a

   Oſſian ; as the poetical compoſitions of other nations are fo cloſely connected with their

   martial honour to an extravagant pitch. Any aid given their heroes in battle, was thought to
   derogate from their fame ; and the bards immediately transferred the glory of the action to him
   who had given that aid.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Had</span> the poet brought down gods, as often as Homer hath done, to aſſiſt his
   heroes, his work had not conſiſted of eulogiums on men, but of hymns to ſuperior beings. Thoſe
   who write in the Galic language ſeldom mention religion in their profane poetry ; and when they
   profeſſedly write of religion, they never mix with their compoſitions, the actions of their
   heroes, This cuſtom alone, even though the religion of the Druids had not been previouſly
   extinguiſhed, may, in ſome meaſure, excuſe the author's ſilence concerning the religion of
   ancient times.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">To</span> allege, that a nation is void of all religion, would betray ignorance of
   the hiſtory of mankind. The traditions of their fathers, and their own obſervations on the works

   believe that he exiſts. It would be doing injuſtice to the author of theſe poems, to think, that
   he had not opened his conceptions to that primitive and greateſt of all truths. But let his
   religion be what it will, it is certain he has not alluded to Chriſtianity, or any of its rites,
   in his poems ; which ought to fix his opinions, at leaſt, to an æra prior to that religion.
   Conjectures, on this ſubject, muſt ſupply the place of proof. The perſecution begun by
   Dioclefian, in the year 303, is the moſt probable time in which the firſt dawning of Chriſtianity
   in the north of Britain can be fixed. The humane and mild character of Conſtantius Chlorus, who
   commanded then in Britain, induced the perſecuted Chriftians to take refuge under him. Some of
   them, through a zeal to propagate their tenets, or through fear, went beyond the pale of the
   Roman empire, and ſettled among the Caledonians; who were ready to hearken to their doctrines, if
   the religion of the Druids was exploded long before.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">These</span> miſſionaries, either through choice, or to give more weight to the
   doctrine they advanced, took poſſeſſion of the cells and groves of the Druids; and it was from

    language of the country ſignified <i>ſequeſtered
   perſons</i>. It was with one of the <i>Culdees</i> that Oſſian, in his extreme old age, is
   ſaid to have diſputed concerning the Chriftian religion. This diſpute, they ſay, is extant, and
   is couched in verſe, according to the cuſtom of the times. The extreme ignorance on the part of
   Oſſian, of the Chriſtian tenets, ſhews, that that religion had only been lately introduced, as it
   is not eafy to conceive, how one of the firſt rank could be totally unacquainted with a religion
   that had been known for any time in the country. The diſpute bears the genuine marks of
   antiquity. The obſolete phraſes and expreſſions peculiar to the times, prove it to be no forgery.
   If Oſſian then lived at the introduction of Chriſtianity, as by all appearance he did, his epoch
   will be the latter end of the third, and beginning of the fourth century. Tradition here ſteps in

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> the year 210 the emperor Severus, after returning from his expedition
   againſt the Caledonians, at York fell into the tedious illneſs of which he afterwards died. The
   Caledonians and Maiatæ, reſuming courage from his indiſpoſition, took arms in order to recover
   the poſſeſſions they had loſt. The enraged emperor commanded his army to march into their
   country, and to deſtroy it with fire and ſword. His orders were but ill executed, for his ſon,
   Caracalla, was at the head of the army, and his thoughts were entirely taken up with the hopes of
   his father's death, and with ſchemes to ſupplant his brother Geta. --- He ſcarcely had entered

   more than probable, that the Caros mentioned here, is the ſame with the noted uſurper Caraufius,
   who aſſumed the purple in the year 287, and ſeizing on Britain, defeated the emperor Maximian
   Herculius, in ſeveral naval engagements, which gives propriety to his being called <i>the King
   of Ships</i>. The <i>winding Carun</i> is that ſmall river retaining ſtill the name of Carron,
   and runs in the neighbourhood of Agricola's wall, which Carauſius repaired to obſtruct the
   incurſions of the Caledonians. Several other paſſages in traditions allude to the wars of the
   Romans ; but the two juſt mentioned clearly fix the epocha of Fingal to the third century ; and
   this account agrees exactly with the Iriſh hiſtories, which place the death of Fingal, the ſon of

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Every</span> one knows what a cloud of ignorance and barbariſm overſpread the north

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſtrongeſt objection to the antiquity of the poems now given to the

   Druids, did not ſhare their bad fortune. They were ſpared by the victorious king, as it was
   through their means only he could hope for immortality to his fame. They attended him in the
   camp, and contributed to eſtabliſh his power by their ſongs. His great actions were magnified,
   and the populace, who had no ability to examine into his character narrowly, were dazzled with
   his fame in the rhimes of the bards. In the mean time, men aſſumed ſentiments that are rarely to
   be met with in an age of barbariſm. The bards who were originally the diſciples of the Druids,
   had their minds opened, and their ideas enlarged, by being initiated in the learning of that
   celebrated order. They could form a perfect hero in their own minds, and aſcribe that character
   to their prince. The inferior chiefs made this ideal character the model of their conduct, and by
   degrees brought their minds to that generous ſpirit which breathes in all the poetry of the
   times. The prince, flattered by his bards, and rivalled by his own heroes, who imitated his
   character as deſcribed in the eulogies of his poets, endeavoured to excel his people in merit,

    as he was above them in ſtation. This emulation continuing, formed at
   laſt the general character of the nation, happily compounded of what is noble in barbarity, and
   virtuous and generous in a poliſhed people.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">When</span> virtue in peace, and bravery in war, are the characteriſtics of a
   nation, their actions become intereſting, and their fame worthy of immortality. A generous ſpirit
   is warmed with noble actions, and becomes ambitious of perpetuating them. This is the true ſource
   of that divine inſpiration, to which the poets of all ages pretended. When they found their
   themes inadequate to the warmth of their imaginations, they varniſhed them over with fables,
   ſupplied by their own fancy, or furniſhed by abſurd traditions. Theſe fables, however ridiculous,
   had their abettors; poſterity either implicitly believed them, or through a vanity natural to
   mankind, pretended that they did. They loved to place the founders of their families in the days
   of fable, when poetry, without the fear of contradiction, could give what characters ſhe pleaſed

    heroes, or thoſe who pretended to be deſcended from
   them, heard with pleaſure the eulogiums of their anceſtors ; bards were employed to repeat the
   poems, and to record the connection of their patrons with chiefs ſo renowned. Every chief in
   proceſs of time had a bard in his family, and the office became at laſt hereditary. By the
   ſucceſſion of theſe bards, the poems concerning the anceſtors of the family were handed down from
   generation to generation; they were repeated to the whole clan on ſolemn occaſions, and always
   alluded to in the new compoſitions of the bards. This cuſtom came down to near our own times; and
   after the bards were diſcontinued, a great number in a clan retained by memory, or committed to
   writing, their compoſitions, and founded the antiquity of their families on the authority of
   their poems.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> uſe of letters was not known in the north of Europe till long after the
   inſtitution of the bards : the records of the families of their patrons, their own, and more
   ancient poems were handed down by tradition. Their poetical compoſitions were admirably contrived
   for that purpoſe. They were adapted to muſic; and the moſt perfect harmony was obſerved. Each
   verſe was ſo connected with thoſe which preceded or followed it, that if one line had been

    remembered in a ſtanza, it was almoſt impoſſible to forget the reſt.
   The cadences followed in ſo natural a gradation, and the words were ſo adapted to the common turn
   of the voice, after it is raiſed to a certain key, that it was almoſt impoſſible, from a
   ſimilarity of ſound, to ſubſtitute one word for another. This excellence is peculiar to the
   Celtic tongue, and is perhaps to be met with in no other language. Nor does this choice of words
   clog the ſenſe or weaken the expreſſion. The numerous flections of conſonants, and variation in
   declenſion, make the language very copious.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> deſcendants of the Celtæ, who inhabited Britain and its iſles, were not
   ſingular in this method of preſerving the moſt precious monuments of their nation. The ancient
   laws of the Greeks were couched in verſe, and handed down by tradition. The Spartans, through a
   long habit, became ſo fond of this cuſtom, that they would never allow their laws to be committed
   to writing. The actions of great men, and the eulogiums of kings and heroes, were preſerved in
   the ſame manner. All the hiſtorical monuments of the old Germans were comprehended in their
   ancient ſongs<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753334503472"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>! which were either hymns to their gods, or elegies in

    and were intended to perpetuate the great events in
   their nation which were carefully interwoven with them. This ſpecies of compoſition was not
   committed to writing, but delivered by oral tradition<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753334500688"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>. The care they took to
   have the poems taught to their children, the uninterrupted cuſtom of repeating them upon certain
   occaſions, and the happy meaſure of the verſe, ſerved to preſerve them for a long time
   uncorrupted. This oral chronicle of the Germans was not forgot in the eighth century, and it
   probably would have remained to this day, had not learning, which thinks every thing, that is not
   committed to writing, fabulous, been introduced. It was from poetical traditions that Garcillaſſo
   compoſed his account of the Yncas of Peru. The Peruvians had loft all other monuments of their
   hiſtory, and it was from ancient poems which his mother, a princeſs of the blood of the Yncas,
   taught him in his youth, that he collected the materials of his hiſtory. If other nations then,
   that had been often overrun by enemies, and had ſent abroad and received colonies, could, for
   many ages, preſerve, by oral tradition, their laws and hiſtories uncorrupted, it is much more
   probable that the ancient Scots, a people ſo free of intermixture

   conjecture. Beyond the reach of records, is ſettled a gloom, which no ingenuity can penetrate.
   The manners deſcribed, in theſe poems, ſuit the ancient Celtic times, and no other period, that
   is known in hiſtory. We muſt, therefore, place the heroes far back in antiquity; and it matters
   little, who were their contemporaries in other parts of the world. If we have placed Fingal in
   his proper period, we do honour to the manners of barbarous times. He exercifed every manly
   virtue in Caledonia, while Heliogabalus diſgraced human nature at Rome. </p>

  <h3 class="normal">A DISSERTATION CONCERNING THE POEMS of OSSIAN.</h3>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> hiſtory of thoſe nations, who originally poſſeſſed the north of Europe,
   is leſs known than their manners. Deſtitute of the uſe of letters, they themſelves had not the
   means of tranſmitting their great actions to remote poſterity. Foreign writers ſaw them only at a
   diſtance, and deſcribed them as they found them. The vanity of the Romans induced them to
   conſider the nations beyond the pale of their empire as barbarians; and conſequently their
   hiſtory unworthy of being inveſtigated. Their manners and fingular character were matters of
   curioſity, as they committed them to record. Some men, otherwiſe of great merit among ourſelves,
   give into confined ideas on

    this ſubject. Having early imbibed their idea of
   exalted manners from the Greek and Roman writers, they ſcarcely ever afterwards have the
   fortitude to allow any dignity of character to any nation deſtitute of the uſe of letters.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Without</span> derogating from the fame of Greece and Rome, we may conſider
   antiquity beyond the pale of their empire worthy of ſome attention. The nobler paſſions of the
   mind never ſhoot forth more free and unreſtrained than in the times we call barbarous. That
   irregular manner of life, and thoſe manly purſuits from which barbarity takes its name, are
   highly favorable to a ſtrength of mind unknown in poliſhed times. In advanced ſociety the
   characters of men are more uniform and diſguiſed. The human paſſions lie in ſome degree concealed
   behind forms, and artificial manners; and the powers of the ſoul, without an opportunity of
   exerting them, loſe their vigor. The times of regular government, and poliſhed manners, are
   therefore to be wiſhed for by the feeble and weak in mind. An unſettled ſtate, and thoſe
   convulſions which attend it, is the proper field for an exalted character, and the exertion of
   great parts. Merit there riſes always ſuperior ; no fortuitous event can raiſe the timid and mean
   into power. To thoſe who look upon antiquity in this light,

    it is an agreeable proſpect ; and they alone can have real pleaſure
   in tracing nations to their ſource.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> eſtabliſhment of the Celtic ſtates, in the north of Europe, is beyond
   the reach of written annals. The traditions and ſongs to which they truſted their hiſtory, were
   loſt, or altogether corrupted in their revolutions and migrations, which were ſo frequent and
   univerſal, that no kingdom in Europe is now poſſefed by its original inhabitants. Societies were
   formed, and kingdoms erected, from a mixture of nations, who, in proceſs of time, loſt all
   knowlege of their own origin. If tradition could be depended upon, it is only among a people,
   from all time, free from intermixture with foreigners. We are to look for theſe among the
   mountains and inacceſfible parts of a country : places, on account of their barrenneſs,
   uninviting to an enemy, or whoſe natural ſtrength enabled the natives to repel invaſions. Such
   are the inhabitants of the mountains of Scotland. We, accordingly, find, that they differ
   materially from thoſe who poſſeſs the low and more fertile part of the kingdom. Their language is
   pure and original, and their manners are thoſe of an ancient and unmixed race of men. Conſcious
   of their own antiquity, they long deſpiſed others, as a new and mixed

    people. As they lived in a country only fit for
   paſture, they were free from that toil and buſineſs, which engroſs the attention of a commercial
   people. Their amuſement conſiſted in hearing or repeating their ſongs and traditions, and theſe
   intirely turned on the antiquity of their nation, and the exploits of their forefathers. It is no
   wonder, therefore, that there are more remains of antiquity among them, than among any other
   people in Europe. Traditions, however, concerning remote periods, are only to be regarded, in ſo
   far as they co-incide with cotemporary writers of undoubted credit and veracity.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">No</span> writers began their accounts from a more early period, than the
   hiſtorians of the Scots nation. Without records, or even tradition itſelf, they give a long liſt
   of ancient kings, and a detail of their tranſactions, with a ſcrupulous exactneſs. One might
   naturally ſuppoſe, that, when they had no authentic annals, they ſhould, at leaſt, have recourſe
   to the traditions of their country, and have reduced them into a regular ſyſtem of hiſtory. Of
   both they ſeem to have been equally deſtitute. Born in the low country, and ſtrangers to the
   ancient language of their nation, they contented themſelves with copying from one another, and
   retailing the ſame fictions, in a new colour and dreſs.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">John Fordunn</span> was the firſt who collected thoſe fragments of the Scots
   hiſtory, which had eſcaped the brutal policy of Edward I. and reduced them into order. His
   accounts, in ſo far as they concerned recent tranſactions, deſerved credit : beyond a certain
   period, they were fabulous and unſatisfactory. Some time before Fordun wrote, the king of
   England, in a letter to the pope, had run up the antiquity of his nation to a very remote æra.
   Fordun, poſſeſſed of all the national prejudice of the age, was unwilling that his country ſhould
   yield, in point of antiquity, to a people, then its rivals and enemies. Deſtitute of annals in
   Scotland, he had recourſe to Ireland, which, according to the vulgar errors of the times, was
   reckoned the firſt habitation of the Scots. He found, there, that the Iriſh bards had carried
   their pretenſions to antiquity as high, if not beyond any nation in Europe. It was from them he
   took thoſe improbable fictions, which form the firſt part of his hiſtory.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> writers that ſucceeded Fordun implicitly followed his ſyſtem, though
   they ſometimes varied from him in their relations of particular tranſactions, and the order of

    traditions of their country, their hiſtories contain
   little information concerning the origin of the Scots. Even Buchanan himſelf, except the elegance
   and vigour of his ſtile, has very little to recommend him. Blinded with political prejudices, he
   ſeemed more anxious to turn the fictions of his predeceſſors to his own purpoſes, than to detect
   their miſrepreſentations, or inveſtigate truth amidſt the darkneſs which they had thrown round
   it. It therefore appears, that little can be collected from their own hiſtorians, concerning the
   firſt migration of the Scots into Britain. </p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">That</span> this iſland was peopled from Gaul admits of no doubt. Whether colonies
   came afterwards from the north of Europe is a matter of meer ſpeculation. When South-Britain
   yielded to the power of the Romans, the unconquered nations to the north of the province were
   diſtinguiſhed by the name of <i>Caledonians</i>. From their very name, it appears, that they
   were of thoſe Gauls, who poſſeſſed themſelves originally of Britain. It is compounded of two
   <i>Celtic</i> words, <i>Caël</i> ſignifying <i>Celts</i>, or <i>Gauls</i>, and
   <i>Dun</i> or <i>Don</i>, a hill; ſo that <i>Caël-don</i>, or Caledonians, is as much as to
   ſay, the <i>Celts of the hill country</i>. The Highlanders, to this day, call themſelves
   <i>Caël</i>, their language <i>Caëlic</i>, or <i>Galic</i>, and their country

    <i>Caëldoch</i>, which the Romans ſoftened into
   <i>Caledonia</i>. This, of itſelf, is ſufficient to demonſtrate, they are the genuine
   deſcendents of the ancient Caledonians, and not a pretended colony of <i>Scots</i>, who ſettled
   firſt in the north, in the third or fourth century.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">From</span> the double meaning of the word <i>Caël</i>, which ſignifies
   <i>ſtrangers</i>, as well as <i>Gauls</i>,or <i>Celts</i>, ſome have imagined, that the
   anceſtors of the Caledonians were of a different race from the reſt of the Britons, and that they
   received their name upon that account. This opinion, ſay they, is ſupported by Tacitus, who, from
   ſeveral circumſtances, concludes, that the Caledonians were of German extraction. A diſcuſſion of
   a point ſo intricate, at this diſtance of time, could neither be fatisfaſtory nor important.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Towards</span> the latter end of the third, and beginning of the fourth century, we
   meet with the Scots in the north. Porphyrius<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753334451104"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a> makes the firſt mention of them about that time. As
   the Scots were not heard of before that period, moſt writers ſuppoſed them to have been a colony,
   newly come to Britain, and that the <i>Picts</i> were the only genuine deſcendents of the
   ancient Caledonians. This miſtake is eaſily removed. The

    Caledonians, in proceſs of time, became naturally
   divided into two diſtinct nations, as poſſeſſing parts of the country, intirely different in
   their nature and ſoil. The weſtern coaſt of Scotland is hilly and barren ; towards the eaſt the
   country is plain, and fit for tillage. The inhabitants of the mountains, a roving and
   uncontrouled race of men, lived by feeding of cattle, and what they killed in hunting. Their
   employment did not fix them to one place. They removed from one heath to another, as ſuited beſt
   with their convenience or inclination. They were not, therefore, improperly called, by their
   neighbours, <span class="sc">Scuite</span>, or <i>the wandering nation</i> ; wiuch is evidently the
   origin of the Roman name of <i>Scoti</i>.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">On</span> the other hand, the Caledonians, who poſſeſſed the eaſt coaſt of
   Scotland, as the diviſion of the country was plain and fertile, applied themſelves to
   agriculture, and raiſing of corn. It was from this, that the Galic name of the <i>Picts</i>
   proceeded; for they are called, in that language, <i>Cruithnich</i>, i. e. <i>the wheat or
   corn-eaters</i>. As the Picts lived in a country ſo different in its nature from that poſſeſſed
   by the Scots, ſo their national character ſuffered a material change. Unobſtructed by mountains,
   or lakes, their communication with one another was free and frequent.

    Society, therefore, became ſooner eſtabliſhed among them, than
   among the Scots, and, conſequently, they were much ſooner governed by civil magiſtrates and laws.
   This, at laſt, produced ſo great a difference in the manners of the two nations, that they began
   to forget their common origin, and almoſt continual quarrels and animoſities ſubſiſted between
   them. Theſe animoſities, after ſome ages, ended in the ſubverſion of the Pictiſh kingdom, but not
   in the total extirpation of the nation, according to moſt of the Scots writers, who ſeemed to
   think it more for the honour of their countrymen to annihilate, than reduce a rival people under
   their obedience. It is certain, however, that the very name of the Picts was loſt, and thoſe that
   remained were ſo completely incorporated with their conquerors, that they ſoon loſt all memory of
   their own origin.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> end of the Pictiſh government is placed ſo near that period, to which

    and the very names of their kings, which are handed
   down to us, are of Galic original, which is a convincing proof, that the two nations were, of
   old, one and the ſame, and only divided into two governments, by the effect which their ſituation
   had upon the genius of the people.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> name of <i>Picts</i> is ſaid to have been given by the Romans to the
   Caledonians, who poſſeſſed the eaſt coaſt of Scotland, from their painting their bodies. The
   ſtory is ſilly and the argument abſurd. But let us revere antiquity in her very follies. This
   circumſtance made ſome imagine, that the Picts were of Britiſh extract, and a different race of
   men from the Scots. That more of the Britons, who fled northward from the tyranny of the Romans,
   ſettled in the low country of Scotland, than among the Scots of the mountains, may be eaſily
   imagined, from the very nature of the country. It was they who introduced painting among the
   Picts. From this circumſtance, affirm ſome antiquaries, proceeded the name of the latter, to
   diſtinguiſh them from the Scots, who never had that art among them, and from the Britons, who
   diſcontinued it after the Roman conqueſt.</p>

   dangerous firths. It is, therefore, highly probable, that they, very early, found their way to
   the north of Ireland, which is within ſight of their own country. That Ireland was firſt peopled
   from Britain is, at length, a matter that admits of no doubt. The vicinity of the two iſlands;
   the exact correſpondence of the ancient inhabitants of both, in point of manners and language,
   are ſufficient proofs, even if we had not the teſtimony of<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753334429552"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a> authors of undoubted veracity to confirm it. The abettors of the
   moſt romantic ſyſtems of Iriſh antiquities allow it; but they place the colony from Britain in an
   improbable and remote æra. I ſhall eaſily admit, that the colony of the <i>Firbolg</i>,
   confeſſedly the Belgæ of Britain, ſettled in the ſouth of Ireland, before the Caël, or
   Caledonians, diſcovered the north; but it is not at all likely, that the migration of the Firbolg

    inhabitants of Ireland, that eyery unbiaſſed perſon
   will confeſs them more probable, than the legends handed down, by tradition, in that country. It
   appears, that, in the days of Trathal, grandfather to Fingal, Ireland was poſſeſſed by two
   nations; the <i>Firbolg</i> or <i>Belgæ</i> of Britain, who inhabited the ſouth, and the
   Caël, who paſſed over from Caledonia and the Hebrides to Ulfter. The two nations, as is uſual
   among an unpoliſhed and lately ſettled people, were divided into ſmall dynaſties, ſubject to
   petty kings, or chiefs, independent of one another. In this ſituation, it is probable, they
   continued long, without any material revolution in the ſtate of the iſland, until Crothar, Lord
   of Atha, a country in Connaught, the moſt potent chief of the <i>Firbolg</i>, carried away
   Conlama, the daughter of Cathmin, a chief of the Caël, who poſſeſſed Ulſter.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Conlama</span> had been betrothed ſome time before to Turloch, a chief of their own
   nation. Turloch reſented the affront offered him by Crothar, made an irruption into Connaught,
   and killed Cormul, the brother of Crothar, who came to oppoſe his progreſs. Crothar himſelf then
   took arms, and either killed or expelled Turloch. The war, upon this, became general, between the

    reduced to the laſt extremity. In this ſituation, they applied, for
   aid, to Trathal king of Morven, who ſent his brother Conar, already famous for his great
   exploits, to their relief. Conar, upon his arrival in Ulfter, was choſen king, by the unanimous
   conſent of the Caledonian tribes, who poſſeſſed that country. The war was renewed with vigour and
   ſucceſs; but the Firbolg appear to have been rather repelled than ſubdued. In ſucceeding reigns,
   we learn from epiſodes in the ſame poem, that the chiefs of Atha made ſeveral efforts to become
   monarchs of Ireland, and to expel the race of Conar.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">To</span> Conar ſucceeded his ſon Cormac, who appears to have reigned long. In his

   <i>Firbolg</i>, who ſupported the pretenſions of the chiefs of Atha to the Iriſh throne.
   Fingal, who then was very young, came to the aid of Cormac, totally defeated Colc-ulla, chief of
   Atha, and re-eſtabliſhed Cormac in the ſole poſſeſſion of all Ireland. It was then he fell in

   pretenflons to the Iriſh throne, rebelled in the minority of Cormac, defeated his adherents, and
   murdered him in the palace of Temora. Cairbar, lord of Atha, upon this, mounted the throne. His
   uſurpation ſoon ended with his life; for Fingal made an expedition into Ireland, and reſtored,
   after various viciſſitudes of fortune, the family of Conar to the poſſeſſion of the kingdom. This
   war is the ſubject of Temora; the events, though certainly heightened and embelliſhed by poetry,
   ſeem, notwithſtanding, to have their ſoundation in true hiſtory.</p>

   the firſt king of Ireland, we can form no judgment of the time of the ſettlement of the Firbolg.
   It is, however, probable, it was ſome time before the Caël, or Caledonians, ſettled in Ulfter.
   One important fact may be gathered from this hiſtory, that the Iriſh had no king before the
   latter end of the firſt century. Fingal lived, it is ſuppoſed, in the third century ; ſo Conar,
   the firſt monarch of the Iriſh, who was his grand-uncle, cannot be placed farther back than the
   cloſe of the firſt. To eſtabliſh this fact, is to lay, at once, aſide the pretended antiquities
   of the Scots and Iriſh, and to get quit of the long liſt of kings which the latter give us for a
   millennium before.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Of</span> the affairs of Scotiand, it is certain, nothing can be depended upon,
   prior to the reign of Fergus, the ſon of Erc, who lived in the fifth century. The true hiſtory of

    this conſideration, that he begins his hiſtory at the
   introduction of Chriſtianity, remarking, that all that is delivered down, concerning the times of
   paganiſm, were tales of late invention, ſtrangely mixed with anachroniſms and inconſiſtencies.
   Such being the opinion of Ware, who had collected with uncommon induſtry and zeal, all the real
   and pretendedly antient manuſcripts, concerning the hiſtory of his country, we may, on his
   authority, reject the improbable and ſelf-condemned tales of Keating and O'Flaherty. Credulous
   and puerile to the laſt degree, they have diſgraced the antiquities they meant to eſtabliſh. It
   is to be wiſhed, that ſome able Iriſhman, who underſtands the language and records of his
   country, may redeem, ere it is too late, the genuine antiquities of Ireland, from the hands of
   theſe idle fabuliſts.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">By</span> comparing the hiſtory in theſe poems with the legends of the Scots and

    ought, in the judgment of ſober reaſon, to be preferred to
   accounts framed in dark and diſtant periods, with little judgment, and upon no authority.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Concerning</span> the period of more than a century, which intervenes between
   Fingal and the reign of Fergus, the ſon of Erc or Arcath, tradition is dark and contradictory.
   Some trace up the family of Fergus to a ſon of Fingal of that name, who makes a conſiderable
   figure in Oſſian's poems. The three elder ſons of Fingal, Oſſian, Fillan, and Ryno, dying without
   iſſue, the ſucceſſion, of courſe, devolved upon Fergus, the fourth ſon and his poſterity. This
   Fergus, ſay ſome traditions, was the father of Congal, whoſe ſon was Arcath, the father of
   Fergus, properly called the firſt king of Scots, as it was in his time the <i>Caël</i>, who
   poſſeſſed the weſtern coaft of Scotland, began to be diſtinguiſhed, by foreigners, by the name of
   <i>Scots</i> From thenceforward, the Scots and Picts, as diftinct nations, became objects of
   attention to the hiſtorians of other countries. The internal ſtate of the two Caledonian kingdoms

    ſtages in human ſociety. The firſt is the reſult of
   conſanguinity, and the natural affection of the members of a family to one another. The ſecond
   begins when property is eſtabliſhed, and men enter into aſſociations for mutual defence, againſt
   the invaſions and injuſtice of neighbours. Mankind ſubmit, in the third, to certain laws and
   ſubordinations of government, to which they truſt the ſafety of their perſons and property. As
   the firft is formed on nature, ſo, of courſe, it is the moſt diſintereſted and noble. Men, in the
   laſt, have leiſure to cultivate the mind, and to reſtore it, with reflection, to a primæval
   dignity of ſentiment. The middle ſtate is the region of complete barbariſm and ignorance. About
   the beginning of the fifth century, the Scots and Picts were advanced into the ſecond ſtage, and,
   conſequently, into thoſe circumſcribed ſentiments, which always diſtinguiſh barbarity. The events
   which ſoon after happened did not at all contribute to enlarge their ideas, or mend their
   national character.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">About</span> the year 425, the Romans, on account of domeſtic commotions, entirely

    the ſlavery of ſeveral centuries, and thoſe vices, which are
   inſeparable from an advanced ſtate of civility, were not able to withſtand the impetuous, though
   irregular attacks of a barbarous enemy. In the utmoſt diſtreſs, they applied to their old
   maſters, the Romans, and (after the unfortunate ſtate of the Empire could not ſpare aid) to the
   Saxons, a nation equally barbarous and brave, with the enemies of whom they were ſo much afraid.
   Though the bravery of the Saxons repelled the Caledonian nations for a time, yet the latter found
   means to extend themſelves, conſiderably, towards the ſouth. It is, in this period, we muſt place
   the origin of the arts of Civil life among the Scots. The ſeat of government was removed from the
   mountains to the plain and more fertile provinces of the South, to be near the common enemy, in
   caſe of ſudden incurſions. Inſtead of roving through unfrequented wilds, in ſearch of
   ſubſiſtance, by means of hunting, men applied to agriculture, and raiſing of corn. This manner of
   life was the firſt means of changing the national character. The next thing which contributed to
   it was their mixture with ſtrangers.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> the countries which the Scots had conquered from the Britons, it is

    incorporating with the conquerors, taught them
   agriculture, and other arts, which they themſelves had received from the Romans. The Scots,
   however, in number as well as power, being the moſt predominant, retained ſtill their language,
   and as many of the cuſtoms of their anceſtors, as ſuited with the nature of the country they
   poſſeſſed. Even the union of the two Caledonian kingdoms did not much affect the national
   character. Being originally deſcended from the ſame ſtock, the manners of the Picts and Scots
   were as ſimilar as the different natures of the countries they poſſefſed permitted.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">What</span> brought about a total change in the genius of the Scots nation, was
   their wars, and other tranſactions with the Saxons. Several counties in the ſouth of Scotland
   were alternately poſſeſſed by the two nations. They were ceded, in the ninth age, to the Scots,
   and, it is probable, that moſt of the Saxon inhabitants remained in poſſeſſion of their lands.
   During the ſeveral conqueſts and revolutions in England, many fled, for refuge, into Scotland, to
   avoid the oppreſſion of foreigners, or the tyranny of domeſtic uſurpers ; in ſo much, that the

    cuſtoms of the antient Caledonians, till, at laſt, the latter were
   entirely relegated to inhabitants of the mountains, who were ſtill unmixed with ſtrangers.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">It</span> was after the acceſſion of territory which the Scots received, upon the
   retreat of the Romans from Britain, that the inhabitants of the Highlands were divided into
   clans. The king, when he kept his court in the mountains, was conſidered, by the whole nation, as
   the chief of their blood. Their ſmall number, as well as the preſence of their prince, prevented
   thoſe diviſions, which, afterwards, ſprung forth into ſo many ſeparate tribes. When the ſeat of
   government was removed to the ſouth, thoſe who remained in the Highlands were, of courſe,
   neglected. They naturally formed themſelves into ſmall ſocieties, independent of one another.
   Each ſociety had its own <i>regulus</i>, who either was, or in the ſucceſſion of a few
   generations, was regarded as chief of their blood. The nature of the country favoured an

    <span class="sc">The</span> ſeats of the Highland chiefs
   were neither diſagreeable nor inconvenient. Surrounded with mountains and hanging woods, they
   were covered from the inclemency of the weather. Near them generally ran a pretty large river,
   which, diſcharging itſelf not far off, into an arm of the ſea, or extenſive lake, ſwarmed with
   variety of fiſh. The woods were ſtocked with wild-fowl ; and the heaths and mountains behind them
   were the natural ſeat of the red-deer and roe. If we make allowance for the backward ſtate of
   agriculture, the valleys were not unfertile ; affording, if not all the conveniencies, at leaſt
   the neceſſaries of life. Here the chief lived, the ſupreme judge and law-giver of his own people
   ; but his ſway was neither ſevere nor unjuſt. As the populace regarded him as the chief of their
   blood, ſo he, in return, conſidered them as members of his family. His commands therefore, though
   abſolute and decifive, partook more of the authority of a father, than of the rigor of a judge.
   Though the whole territory of the tribe was conſidered as the property of the chief, yet his
   vaſſals made him no other conſideration for their lands than ſervices, neither burdenſome nor
   frequent. As he ſeldom went from home, he was at no expense. His table

   killed in hunting.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> this rural kind of magnificence, the Highland chiefs lived, for many
   ages. At a diſtance from the ſeat of government, and ſecured, by the inacceſſibleneſs of their
   country, they were free and independent. As they had little communication with ſtrangers, the
   cuſtoms of their anceſtors remained among them, and their language retained its original purity.
   Naturally fond of military fame, and remarkably attached to the memory of their anceſtors, they
   delighted in traditions and ſongs, concerning the exploits of their nation, and eſpecially of
   their own particular families. A ſucceſſion of bards was retained in every clan, to hand down the
   memorable actions of their forefathers. As Fingal and his chiefs were the moſt renowned names in
   tradition, the bards took care to place them in the genealogy of every great family. They became
   famous among the people, and an object of fiction and poetry to the bards.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> bards erected their immediate patrons into heroes, and celebrated them

   in a tranſlation. It was chiefly for this reaſon, that I have rejected wholly the works of the
   bards in my publications. Oſſian acted in a more extenſive ſphere, and his ideas ought to be more
   noble and univerſal ; neither gives he, I preſume, ſo many of thoſe peculiarities, which are only
   underſtood in a certain period or country. The other bards have their beauties, but not in this
   ſpecies of compoſition. Their rhimes, only calculated to kindle a martial ſpirit among the
   vulgar, afford very little pleaſure to genuine taſte. This obſervation only regards their poems
   of the heroic kind; in every inferior ſpecies of poetry they are more ſucceſsful. They expreſs
   the tender melancholy of deſponding love, with ſimplicity and nature. So well adapted are the
   ſounds of the words to the ſentiments, that, even without any knowledge of the language they
   pierce and diſſolve the heart. Succeſsful love is expreſſed with peculiar tenderneſs and
   elegance. In all their compoſitions, except the heroic, which was ſolely calculated to animate
   the vulgar, they give us the genuine language of the heart, without any of thoſe affected
   ornaments of phraſeology, which, tho' intended to beautify ſentiments, diveſt them of their
   natural force. The ideas, it is confeſſed,

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">It</span> was the locality of their deſcription and ſentiment, that, probably, has

   are ſo contrary to the preſent advanced ſtate of ſociety, that more than a common mediocrity of
   taſte is required, to reliſh them as they deſerve. Thoſe who alone are capable of transferring

    ſubject and cataſtrophe of the poem are founded upon
   facts, which regarded the firſt peopling of that country, and the conteſts between the two
   Britiſh nations, who originally inhabited that iſland. In a preceding part of this Diſſertation,
   I have ſhewn how ſuperior the probability of this ſyſtem is to the undigeſted fictions of the
   Iriſh bards, and the more recent and regular legends of both Iriſh and Scottiſh hiſtorians. I
   mean not to give offence to the abettors of the high antiquities of the two nations, though I
   have all along expreſſed my doubts, concerning the veracity and abilities of thoſe who deliver
   down their antient hiſtory. For my own part, I prefer the national fame, ariſing from a few
   certain facts, to the legendary and uncertain annals of ages of remote and obſcure antiquity. No
   kingdom now eſtabliſhed in Europe can pretend to equal antiquity with that of the Scots,
   inconſiderable as it may appear in other reſpects, even according to my ſyſtem, ſo that it is

   Without vanity I ſay it, I think I could write tolerable poetry ; and I aſſure my antagoniſts,
   that I ſhould not tranſlate what I could not imitate.</p>
  <p class="noindent">As prejudice is the effect of ignorance, I am not ſurprized at its being general. An age that
   produces few marks of genius ought to be ſparing of admiration. The truth is, the bulk of mankind
   have ever been led, by reputation more than taſte, in articles of literature. If all the Romans,
   who admired Virgil, underſtood his beauties, he would have ſcarce deſerved to have come down to
   us, through ſo many centuries. Unleſs genius were in faſhion, Homer himſelf might have written in

    once, [ ſhall examine the ſubject, without further
   animadverſion on the blunder.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Of</span> all the nations deſcended from the antient <i>Celtæ</i>, the Scots and
   Iriſh are the moſt ſimilar in language, cuſtoms, and manners. This argues a more intimate
   connection between them, than a remote deſcent from the great Celtic ſtock. It is evident, in
   ſhort, that at ſome one period or other, they formed one ſociety, were ſubject to the ſame
   government, and were, in all reſpects, one and the ſame people. How they became divided, which
   the colony, or which the mother nation, I have in another work amply diſcuſſed. The firft
   circumſtance that induced me to diſregard the vulgarly-received opinion of the Hibernian
   extraction of the Scottiſh nation, was my obſervations on their antient language. That dialect of
   the Celtic tongue, ſpoken in the north of Scotland, is much more pure, more agreeable to its
   mother language, and more abounding with primitives, than that now ſpoken, or even that which has
   been written for ſome centuries back, amongſt the moſt unmixed part of the Iriſh nation. A
   Scotchman, tolerably converſant in his own language, underſtands an Iriſh compoſition, from that
   derivative analogy which it has to the <i>Galic</i> of North Britain. An Iriſhman, on the other
   hand, without the aid of ſtudy, can never underſtand

    a compoſition in the Galic tongue. This affords a proof, that the
   Scotch Galic is the moſt original, and, conſequently, the language of a more ancient and unmixed
   people. The Iriſh, however backward they may be to allow any thing to the prejudice of their
   antiquity, ſeem inadvertently to acknowledge it, by the very appellation they give to the dialect
   they ſpeak. They call their own language <i>Caëlic, Eirinach</i>, i. e. <i>Caledonian
   Iriſh</i>, when, on the contrary, they call the dialect of North-Britain <i>a Chaëlic</i>, or
   the <i>Caledonian tongue</i>, emphatically. A circumftance of this nature tends more to decide
   which is the moſt antient nation, than the united teſtimonies of a whole legion of ignorant bards
   and ſenachies, who, perhaps, never dreamed of bringing the Scots from Spain to Ireland, till ſome
   one of them, more learned than the reſt, diſcovered, that the Romans called the firſt
   <i>Iberia</i>, and the latter <i>Hibernia</i>. On ſuch a ſlight foundation were probably
   built the romantic fictions, concerning the Mileſians of Ircland.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">From</span> internal proofs it ſufficiently appears, that the poems publiſhed under
   the name of Oſſian, are not of Iriſh compoſition. The favourite chimæra, that Ireland is the
   mother-country of the Scots, is totally ſubverted and ruined. The fictions concerning the

    of that country, which were forming for ages, and
   growing as they came down, on the hands of ſucceſſive <i>ſenachies</i> and <i>fileas</i>, are
   found, at laſt, to be the ſpurious brood of modern and ignorant ages. To thoſe who know how
   tenacious the Iriſh are, of their pretended <i>Iberian</i> deſcent, this alone is proof
   ſufficient, that poems, ſo ſubverſive of their ſyſtem, could never be produced by an Hibernian
   bard. But when we look to the language, it is ſo different from the Iriſh dialect, that it would
   be as ridiculous to think, that Milton's Paradiſe Loſt could be wrote by a Scottiſh peaſant, as
   to ſuppoſe, that the poems aſcribed to Oſſian were writ in Ireland.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> pretenſions of Ireland to Oſſian proceed from another quarter. There are
   handed down, in that country, traditional poems, concerning the <i>Fiona</i>, or the heroes of
   <i>Fion Mac Comnal</i>. This <i>Fion</i>, ſay the Iriſh annaliſts, was general of the militia
   of Ireland, in the reign of Cormac, in the third century. Where Keating and O'Flaherty learned,
   that Ireland had an <i>embodied</i> militia ſo early, is not eaſy for me to determine. Their
   information certainly did not come from the Iriſh poems,concerning Fion. I have juſt now, in my

    compoſitions; but, unluckily for the antiquities of Ireland, they
   appear to be the work of a very modern period. Every ſtanza, nay almoſt every line, affords
   ſtriking proofs, that they cannot be three centuries old. Their alluſions to the manners and
   cuſtoms of the fifteenth century, are ſo many, that it is matter of wonder to me, how any one
   could dream of their antiquity. They are entirely writ in that romantic taſte, which prevailed
   two ages ago. Giants, enchanted caſtles, dwarfs, palfreys, witches and magicians form the whole
   circle of the poet's invention. The celebrated <i>Fion</i> could ſcarcely move from one hillock
   to another, without encountering a giant, or being entangled in the circles of a magician.
   Witches, on broomſticks, were continually hovering round him, like crows; and he had freed
   enchanted virgins in every valley in Ireland. In ſhort, <i>Fion</i>, great as he was, paſſed a
   diſagreeable life. Not only had he to engage all the miſchiefs in his own country, foreign armies
   invaded him, aſſiſted by magicians and witches, and headed by Kings, as tall as the main-maſt of
   a firſt rate. It muſt be owned, however, that <i>Fion</i> was not inferior to them in height.

    of Fingal in the year 286, yet his ſon Oſſian is made cotemporary
   with St. Patrick, who preached the goſpel in Ireland about the middle of the fifth age. Oſſian,
   though, at that time, he muſt have been two hundred and fifty years of age, had a daughter young
   enough to become wife to the ſaint. On account of this family connection, <i>Patrick of the
   Pſalms</i>, for ſo the apoſtle of Ireland is emphatically called in the poems, took great
   delight in the company of Oſſian, and in hearing the great actions of his family. The ſaint
   ſometimes threw off the aufterity of his profeſſion, drunk freely, and had his ſoul properly
   warmed with wine, to receive with becoming enthuſiaſm, the poems of his father-in-law. One of the
   poems begins with this piece of uſeful information, <span class="quote">

    the <i>Iriſh Oſſian</i> diſcovers the age in which
   he lived, by an unlucky anachroniſm. After deſcribing the total route of Erragon, he very gravely
   concludes with this remarkable anecdote, that none of the foe eſcaped, but a few, who were
   permitted to go on a pilgrimage to the <i>Holy Land</i>. This circumſtance fixes the date of
   the compofition of the piece ſome centuries after the famous croiſade; for, it is evident, that
   the poet thought the time of the croiſade ſo ancient, that he confounds it with the age of
   Fingal. Erragon, in the courſe of this poem, is often called, <span class="quote">
   Riogh <i>Lochlin</i> an do ſhloigh,
    <i>King of Denmark of two nations</i> </span> which alludes to the union of the
   kingdoms of Norway and Denmark, a circumſtance which happened under Margaret de Waldemar, in the
   cloſe of the fourteenth age. Modern, however, as this pretended Oſſian was, it is certain, he
   lived before the Iriſh had dreamed of appropriating <i>Fion</i>, or <i>Fingal</i>, to
   themſelves. He concludes the poem, with this reflection.<span class="quote">

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> next poem that falls under our obſervation is <i>Cath-cabhra</i>, or,
   <i>The death of Oſcar</i>. This piece is founded on the ſame ſtory which we have in the firft
   book of Temora. So little thought the author of Cath-cabhra of making Oſcar his countryman, that,
   in the courſe of two hundred lines, of which the poems conſiſts, he puts the following expreſſion
   thrice in the mouth of the hero :
  <span class="quote">

   <span class="sc">Albion</span> <i>where I was born and bred</i> .</p>
  <p class="noindent">The poem contains almoſt all the incidents in the firſt book of Temora. In one circumſtance the
   bard differs materially from Oſſian. Oſcar, after he was mortally wounded by Cairbar, was carried
   by his people to a neighbouring hill, which commanded a proſpect of the ſea. A fleet appeared at

   St. Patrick, very devoutly recommends the ſoul of his grandſon to his Redeemer.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><i>Duan a Gharibh Mac-Starn</i> is another Iriſh poem in high repute. The grandeur of its

   <i>Caribh Mac-Starn</i> is the ſame with Oſſian's Swaran, the ſon of Starno. His ſingle combats
   with, and his victory over all the heroes of Ireland, excepting the <i>celebrated dog of
   Tara</i>, i. e. Cuthullin, afford matter for two hundred lines of tolerable poetry.
   <i>Caribh</i>'s progreſs in ſearch of Cuthullin, and his intrigue with the gigantic
   Emir-bragal, that hero's wife, enables the poet to extend his piece to four hundred lines. This
   author, it is true, makes Cuthullin a native of Ireland ; the gigantic Emir-bragal he calls the
   <i>guiding ſtar of the women of Ireland</i>. The property of this enormous lady I ſhall not
   diſpute with him, or any other. But, as he ſpeaks with great tenderneſs of the <i>daughters of
   the convent</i>, and throws out ſome hints againſt the Engliſh nation, it is probable he lived
   in too modern a period to be intimately acquainted with the genealogy of Cuthullin.

   in language and ſentiment, ſpeaks very dogmatically of <i>Fion Mac Comnal</i>, as an Iriſhman.
   Little can be ſaid for the judgment of this poet, and leſs for his delicacy of ſentiment. The
   hiſtory of one of his epiſodes may, at once, ſtand as a ſpecimen of his want of both. Ireland, in
   the days of <i>Fion</i>, happened to be threatened with an invaſion, by three great potentates,
   the kings of Lochlin, Sweden, and France. lt is needleſs to inſiſt upon the impropriety of a
   French invaſion of Ireland ; it is ſufficient for me to be faithful to the language of my author.
   <i>Fion</i>, upon receiving intelligence of the intended invaſion, ſent Ca-olt, Oſſian, and
   Oſcar, to watch the bay, in which, it was apprehended, the enemy was to land. Oſcar was the worſt
   choice of a ſcout that could be made, for, brave as he was, he had the bad property of falling
   very often aſleep on his poſt, nor was it poſſible to awake him, without cutting off one of his
   fingers, or daſhing a large ſtone againſt his head. When the enemy appeared, Oſcar, very
   unfortunately, was aſleep. Oſſian and Ca-olt conſulted about the method of wakening him, and
   they, at laſt, fixed on the ſtone, as the leſs dangerous expedient.

    little regard to their government. The Scots, in thoſe
   ages, were often in open war, and never in cordial friendſhip with the Engliſh. The ſimilarity of
   manners and language, the traditions concerning their common origin, and above all, their having
   to do with the ſame enemy, created a free and friendly intercourſe between the Scottiſh and Iriſh
   nations. As the cuſtom of retaining bards and ſenachies was common to both ; ſo each, no doubt,

   Britain. At this time, certainly, was eſtabliſhed that Hibernian ſyſtem of the original of the
   Scots, which afterwards, for want of any other, was univerſally received. The Scots of the
   low-country, who, by lofing the language of their anceſtors, loſt, together with it, their

   bards of Ireland have diſplayed a genius for poetry. It was, alone, in matters of antiquity, that
   they were monſtrous in their fables. Their love-ſonnets, and their elegies on the death of
   perſons worthy or renowned, abound with ſimplicity, and a wild harmony of numbers. They become
   more than an atonement for their errors, in every other ſpecies of poetry. But the beauty of
   theſe pieces, depends ſo much on a certain <i>curioſa felicitas</i> of expreſſion in the

  <h3 class="normal">A critical dissertation on the poems of Ossian,the son of Fingal.</h3>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Among</span> the monuments remaining of the ancient ſtate of nations, few are more
   valuable than their poems or ſongs. Hiſtory, when it treats of remote or dark ages, is ſeldom
   very inſtructive. The beginnings of ſociety, in every country, are involved in fabulous
   confuſion; and though they were not, they would furniſh few events worth recording. But, in every
   period of ſociety, human manners are a curious ſpectacle; and the moſt natural pictures of
   ancient manners are exhibited in the ancient poems of nations. Theſe preſent to us what is much
   more valuable than the hiſtory of ſuch tranſactions as a rude age can afford—the hiſtory

They make
   us acquainted with the notions and feelings of our fellow creatures in the moſt artleſs ages;
   Diſcovering what objects they admired, and what pleaſures they purſued, before thoſe refinements
   of ſociety had taken place, which enlarge, indeed, and diverſify the tranſactions, but diſguiſe
   the manners of mankind. </p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Beſides</span> this merit which ancient poems have with philoſophical obſervers of
   human nature, they have another with perſons of taſte. They promiſe ſome of the higheſt beauties
   of poetical writing. Irregular and unpoliſhed we may expect the production of uncultivated ages
   to be; but abounding, at the ſame time, with that enthuſiaſm, that vehemence and fire, which are
   the ſoul of poetry: for many circumſtances of thoſe times which we call barbarous, are favourable
   to the poetical ſpirit. That ſtate, in which human nature ſhoots wild and free, though unfit for
   other improvements, certainly encourages the high exertions of fancy and paſſion.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> the infancy of ſocieties, men live ſcattered and diſperſed in the midſt

   the ſudden changes of fortune occurring in their unſettled ſtate of life, their paſſions are
   raiſed to the utmoſt; their paſſions have nothing to reſtrain them, their imagination has nothing
   to check it. They diſplay themſelves to one another without diſguiſe, and converſe and act in the
   uncovered ſimplicity of nature. As their feelings are ſtrong, ſo their language, of itſelf,
   aſſumes a poetical turn. Prone to exaggerate, they deſcribe everything in the ſtrongeſt colours;
   which of courſe renders their ſpeech pictureſque and figurative. Figurative language owes its
   riſe chiefly to two cauſes; to the want of proper names for objects, and to the influence of
   imagination and paſſion over the form of expreſſion. Both theſe cauſes concur in the infancy of
   ſociety. Figures are commonly conſidered as artificial modes of ſpeech, deviſed by orators and
   poets, after the world had advanced to a refined ſtate. The contrary of this is the truth. Men
   never have uſed ſo many figures of ſtyle as in thoſe rude ages, when, beſides the power of a warm
   imagination to ſuggeſt lively images, the want of proper and preciſe terms for the ideas they
   would expreſs, obliged them to have recourſe to circumlocution, metaphor, compariſon, and all
   thoſe ſubſtituted forms of expreſſion, which give a poetical air to language.

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> the progreſs of ſociety, the genius and manners of men undergo a change
   more favourable to accuracy than to ſprightlineſs and ſublimity. As the world advances, the
   underſtanding gains ground upon the imagination; the underſtanding is more exerciſed; the
   imagination, leſs. Fewer objects occur that are new or ſurpriſing. Men apply themſelves to trace
   the cauſes of things; they correct and refine one another; they ſubdue or diſguiſe their
   paſſions; they form their exterior manners upon one uniform ſtandard of politeneſs and civility.
   Human nature is pruned according to method and rule. Language advances from ſterility to
   copiouſneſs, and at the ſame time from fervor and enthuſiaſm, to correctneſs and preciſion. Style
   becomes more chaſte, but leſs animated. The progreſs of the world in this reſpect reſembles the
   progreſs of age in man. The powers of imagination are moſt vigorous and predominant in youth;
   thoſe of the underſtanding ripen more ſlowly, and often attain not to their maturity till the

   of ſociety As the ideas of our youth are remembered with a peculiar pleaſure, on account of their
   livelineſs and vivacity, ſo the moſt ancient poems have often proved the greateſt favourites of
   nations.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Poetry</span> has been ſaid to be more ancient than proſe; and, however paradoxical
   ſuch an aſſertion may ſeem, yet, in a qualified ſenſe, it is true. Men certainly never converſed
   with one another in regular numbers; but even their ordinary language would, in ancient times,
   for the reaſons before aſſigned, approach to a poetical ſtyle; and the firſt compoſitions
   tranſmitted to poſterity, beyond doubt, were, in a literal ſenſe, poems; that is, compoſitions in
   which imagination had the chief hand, formed into ſome kind of numbers, and pronounced with a
   muſical modulation or tone. Muſic or ſong has been found coeval with ſociety among the moſt
   barbarous nations. The only ſubjects which could prompt men, in their firſt rude ſtate, to utter
   their thoughts in compoſitions of any length, were ſuch as naturally aſſumed the tone of poetry;
   praiſes of their gods, or of their anceſtors; commemorations of their own warlike exploits, or
   lamentations over their miſfortunes.

   compoſitions, except ſongs or poems, could take ſuch hold of the imagination and memory, as to be
   preſerved by oral tradition, and handed down from one race to another.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Hence</span> we may expect to find poems among the antiquities of all nations. It
   is probable, too, that an extenſive ſearch would diſcover a certain degree of reſemblance among
   all the moſt ancient poetical productions, from whatever country they have proceeded. In a
   ſimilar ſtate of manners, ſimilar objects and paſſions, operating upon the imaginations of men,
   will ſtamp their productions with the ſame general character. Some diverſity will, no doubt, be
   occaſioned by climate and genius. But mankind never bear ſuch reſembling features as they do in
   the beginnings of ſociety. Its ſubſequent revolutions give riſe to the principal diſtinctions
   among nations; and divert, into channels widely ſeparated, that current of human genius and
   manners which deſcends originally from one ſpring. What we have been long accuſtomed to call the
   oriental vein of poetry, becauſe ſome of the earlieſt poetical productions have come to us from
   the eaſt, is probably no more oriental than Occidental: it is characteriſtical of an age rather
   than a country,

   not ſo much of the eaſt, or of the Greeks and Romans, as of the northern nations, in order to
   diſcover whether the Gothic poetry has any reſemblance to the Celtic or Gaelic, which we are
   about to conſider. Though the Goths, under which name we uſually comprehend all the Scandinavian
   tribes, were a people altogether fierce and martial, and noted, to a proverb for their ignorance
   of the liberal arts, yet they too, from the earlieſt times, had their poets and their ſongs.

   paraphiaſtical, and forced into ſuch an imitation of the ſtyle and the meaſures of the Roman
   poets, that one can form no judgment from them of the native ſpirit of the original. A more
   curious monument of the true Gothic poetry is preſerved by Olaus Wormius in his book de
   Literatura Runica. It is an epicedium, or funeral ſong, compoſed by Regner Lodbrog, and
   tranſlated by Olaus, word for word, from the original. This Lodbrog was a king of Denmark, who
   lived in the eighth century, famous for his wars and victories; and at the ſame time an eminent
   <i>ſcalder</i>, or poet. It was his miſfortune to fall at laſt into the hands of one of his
   enemies, by whom he was thrown into priſon, and condemned to he deſtroyed by ſerpents. In this
   ſituation he ſolaced himſelf with rehearſing all the exploits of his life. The poem is divided
   into twenty-nine ſtanzas, of ten lines each; and every ſtanza begins with theſe words,

The crows around the Indirian iſlands
   had an ample prey. It were difficult to ſingle out one among ſo many deaths. At the riſing of the
   ſun I beheld the ſpears piercing the bodies of foes, and the bows throwing forth their
   ſteel-pointed arrows. Loud roared the ſwords in the plains of Lano.—The virgin long bewailed the
   ſlaughter of that morning.”—In this ſtrain the poet continues to deſcribe ſeveral other military
   exploits. The images are not much varied: the noiſe of arms, the ſtreaming of blood, and the
   feaſting the birds of prey often recurring. He mentions the death of two of his ſons in battle;
   and the lamentation he deſcribes as made for one of them is very ſingular. A Grecian or a Roman
   poet would have introduced the virgins or nymphs of the wood bewailing the untimely fall of a
   young hero. But, ſays our Gothic poet, “When Rogvaldus was ſlain, for him mourned all the hawks
   of heaven,” as lamenting a benefactor who had ſo liberally ſupplied them with prey; “for boldly,”
   as he adds, “in the ſtrife of ſwords did the breaker of helmets throw the ſpear of blood.”</p>

   not ſit in peace. Fifty and one times have I reared the ſtandard in battle. In my youth I learned
   to dye the ſword in blood: my hope was then that no king among men would be more renowned than
   me. The goddeſſes of death will now ſoon call me; I muſt not mourn my death. Now I end my ſong.
   The goddeſſes invite me away; they whom Odin has ſent to me from his hall. I will ſit upon a

   predominant over fierceneſs and barbarity. Our hearts are melted with the ſofteſt feelings, and
   at the ſame time elevated with the higheſt ideas of magnanimity, generoſity, and true heroiſm.

   Celtæ or Gauls are mentioned by ancient writers, we ſeldom fall to hear of their Druids and their

   diſcipline and manners, which appears to have had a deep and laſting influence. Ammianus
   Marcellinus gives them this expreſs teſtimony, that there flouriſhed among them the ſtudy of the

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">So</span> ſtrong was the attachment of the Celtic nations to their poetry and
   bards, that, amidſt all the changes of their government and manners, even long after the order of
   the druids was extinct, and the national religion altered, the bards continued to flouriſh; not
   as a ſet of ſtrolling ſongſters, like the Greek Αοιδοι, or Rhapſodiſts, in Homer's time, but as
   an order of men highly reſpected in the ſtate, and ſupported by a public eſtabliſhment. We find

   we find them remaining under the ſame name, and exerciſing the ſame functions as of old, in
   Ireland, and in the north of Scotland, almoſt down to our own times. It is well known, that in
   both theſe countries every <i>Regulus</i> or chief had his own bard, who was conſidered as an
   officer of rank in his court; and had lands aſſigned him, which deſcended to his family. Of the
   honour in which the bards were held, many inſtances occur in Oſſian's Poems. On all important

   to the bards, though his ſoul was dark. 'Looſe the bards,' ſaid his brother Cathmor, 'they are
   the ſons of other times. Their voice ſhall be heard in other ages, when the kings of Temora have

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">From</span> all this, the Celtic tribes clearly appear to have been addicted in ſo
   high a degree to poetry, and to have made it ſo much their ſtudy from the earlieſt times, as may
   remove our wonder at meeting with a vein of higher poetical refinement among them, than was at
   firſt to have been expected among nations whom we are accuſtomed to call barbarous. Barbarity, I
   muſt obſerve, is a very equivocal term; it admits of many different forms and degrees; and
   though, in all of them, it excludes poliſhed manners, it is, however, not inconſiſtent with
   generous ſentiments and tender affections. <a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333967488"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>

   manners, nearly approaching to the poetical; and in forming even ſuch a hero as Fingal.
   Eſpecially when we conſider, that among their limited objects of ambition, among the few
   advantages which, in a ſavage ſtate, man could obtain over man, the chief was fame, and that
   immortality which they expected to receive from their virtues and exploits, in ſongs of

In
   one remarkable paſſage Oſſian deſcribes himſelf as living in a ſort of claſſical age, enlightened
   by the memorials of former times, which were conveyed in the ſongs of bards; and points at a
   period of darkneſs and ignorance which lay beyond the reach of tradition. “His words,” ſays he,
   “Came only by halves to our ears; they were dark as the tales of other times, before the light of
   the ſong aroſe.” Oſſian himſelf appears to have been endowed by nature with an exquiſite
   ſenſibility of heart; prone to that tender melancholy which is ſo often an attendant on great
   genius: and ſuſceptible equally of ſtrong and of ſoft emotion. He was not only a profeſſed bard,
   educated with care, as we may eaſily believe, to all the poetical art then known, and connected,
   as he ſhews us himſelf, in intimate friendſhip with the other contemporary bards, but a warrior
   alſo; and the ſon of the moſt renowned hero and prince of his age. This formed a conjunction of
   circumſtances uncommonly favourable towards exalting the imagination of a poet. He relates
   expeditions in which he had been engaged; he ſings of battles in which he had fought and
   overcome; he had beheld the moſt illuſtrious ſcenes which that age could exhibit, both of heroiſm

For however
   rude the magnificence of thoſe times may ſeem to us, we muſt remember, that all ideas of
   magnificence are comparative; and that the age of Fingal was an æra of diſtinguiſhed ſplendor in
   that part of the world. Fingal reigned over a conſiderable territory; he was enriched with the
   ſpoils of the Roman province; he was ennobled by his victories and great actions; and was in all
   reſpects a perſonage of much higher dignity than any of the chieftains, or heads of clans, who
   lived in the ſame country, after a more extenſive monarchy was eſtabliſhed,</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> manners of Oſſian's age, ſo far as we can gather them from his writings,
   were abundantly favourable to a poetical genius. The two diſpiriting vices, to which Longinus
   imputes the decline of poetry, covetouſneſs and effeminacy, were as yet unknown. The cares of men
   were few. They lived a roving indolent life; hunting and war their principal employments; and
   their chief amuſements, the muſic of bards, and the feaſt of ſhells.” The great objects purſued
   by heroic ſpirits, was “to receive their fame;” that is, to become worthy of being celebrated in
   the ſongs of bards; and “to have their name on the four gray ſtones.” To die unlamented by a
   bard, was deemed ſo great a miſfortune as

   ſtate. They wander in thick miſts beſide the reedy lake but never ſhall they riſe, without the
   ſong, to the dwelling of winds.” After death, they expected to follow employments of the ſame
   nature with thoſe which had amuſed them on earth; to fly with their friends on clouds, to purſue
   airy deer, and to liſten to their praiſe in the mouths of bards. In ſuch times as theſe, in a
   country where poetry had been ſo long cultivated, and ſo highly honoured, is it any wonder that,
   among the race and ſucceſſion of bards, one Homer ſhould ariſe: a man, who, endowed with a
   natural happy genius, favoured with peculiar advantages of birth and condition, and meeting, in
   the courſe of his life, with a variety of incidents proper to fire his imagination, and to touch

   this, as the ideas of property begin to take root; next agriculture; and, laſtly, commerce.
   Throughout Oſſian's Poems we plainly find ourſelves in the firſt of theſe periods of ſociety;
   during which hunting was the chief employment of men, and the principal method of their procuring
   ſubſiſtence. Paſturage was not indeed wholly unknown; for we hear of dividing the herd in the
   caſe of a divorce; but the alluſions to herds and to cattle are not many; and of agriculture we
   find no traces. No cities appear to have been built in the territories of Fingal. No arts are

At
   their feaſts, the heroes prepared their own repaſt; they ſat round the light of the burning oak;
   the wind lifted their locks, and whiſtled through their open halls. Whatever was beyond the
   neceſſaries of life was known to them only as the ſpoil of the Roman province; “the gold of the
   ſtranger; the lights of the ſtranger; the ſteeds of the ſtranger; the children of the rein.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">This</span> repreſentation of Oſſian's times muſt ſtrike us the more, as genuine
   and authentick, when it is compared with a poem of later date, which Mr. Macpherſon has preſerved
   in one of his notes. It is that in which five bards are repreſented as paſſing the evening in the
   houſe of a chief, and each of them ſeparately giving his deſcription of the night. The night
   ſcenery is beautiful; and the author has plainly imitated the ſtyle and manner of Oſſian; but he
   has allowed ſome images to appear which betray a later period of ſociety. For we meet with

   ſeeking ſhelter, the ſhepherd wandering, corn on the plain, and the wakeful hind rebuilding the
   ſhocks of corn which had been overturned by the tempeſt. Whereas, in Oſſian's works, from
   beginning to end, all is conſiſtent; no modern alluſion drops from him; but everywhere the ſame
   face of rude nature appears; a country wholly uncultivated, thinly inhabited, and recently
   peopled. The graſs of the rock, the flower of the heath, the thiſtle with its beard, are the
   chief ornaments of his landſcapes. “The deſert,” ſays Fingal, “is enough for me, with all its
   woods and deer.”</p>

   among ſavage nations, from the ſlighteſt cauſes. To be affronted at a tournament, or to be
   omitted in the invitation to a feaſt, kindles a war. Women are often carried away by force; and
   the whole tribe, as in the Homeric times, riſe to avenge the wrong. The heroes ſhow refinement of

   exploits, and ſing their own praiſe. In their battles, it is evident, that drums, trumpets, or
   bagpipes, were not known or uſed. They had no expedient for giving the military alarms but
   ſtriking a ſhield, or raiſing a loud cry: and hence the loud and terrible voice of Fingal is
   often mentioned as a neceſſary qualification of a great general; like the <i>βοην αγαθος Μενελαος</i> of Homer. Of military diſcipline or ſkill they appear to have
   been entirely deſtitute. Their armies ſeem not to have been numerous; their battles were
   diſorderly; and terminated, for the moſt part, by a perſonal combat, or wreſtling of the two
   chiefs; after which, “the bard ſung the ſong of peace, and the battle ceaſed along the

   ſterility of language and the want of proper terms, have always introduced into the early ſpeech
   of nations; and in ſeveral reſpects, it carries a remarkable reſemblance to the ſtyle of the Old
   Teſtament. It deſerves particular notice, as one of the moſt genuine and deciſive characters of
   antiquity, that very few general terms, or abſtract ideas, are to be met with in the whole
   collection of Oſſian's works. The ideas of men, at firſt, were all particular. They had not words
   to expreſs general conceptions. Theſe were the conſequences of more profound reflection, and
   longer acquaintance with the arts of thought and of ſpeech. Oſſian, accordingly, almoſt never
   expreſſes himſelf in the abſtract. His ideas extended little further than to the objects he ſaw
   around him. A public, a community, the univerſe, were conceptions beyond his ſphere. Even a
   mountain, a ſea, or a lake, which he has occaſion to mention, though only in a ſimile, are for
   the moſt part particularized; it is the hill of Cromla, the ſtorm of the ſea of Malmor, or the
   reeds of the lake of Lego. A mode of expreſſion which, while it is characteriſtical of ancient
   ages, is at the ſame time highly favourable to deſcriptive poetry. For the ſame reaſons,
   perſonification is a poetical figure not

Inanimate objects,
   ſuch as winds, trees, flowers, he ſometimes perſonifies with great beauty. But the
   perſonifications which are ſo familiar to later poets, of Fame, Time, Terror, Virtue, and the
   reſt of that claſs, were unknown to our Celtic bard. Theſe were modes of conception too abſtract
   for his age.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">All</span> theſe are marks ſo undoubted, and ſome of them, too ſo nice and
   delicate, of the moſt early times, as put the high antiquity of theſe poems out of queſtion.
   Eſpecially when we conſider, that if there had been any impoſture in this caſe, it muſt have been
   contrived and executed in the Highlands of Scotland, two or three centuries ago; as up to this
   period, both by manuſcripts, and by the teſtimony of a multitude of living witneſſes, concerning
   the uncontrovertible tradition of theſe poems, they can clearly be traced. Now, this is a period
   when that country enjoyed no advantages for a compoſition of this kind, which it may not be
   ſuppoſed to have enjoyed in as great, if not in a greater degree, a thouſand years before. To
   ſuppoſe that two or three hundred years ago, when we well know the Highlands to have been in a

   years; one who could ſupport this counterfeited antiquity through ſuch a large collection of
   poems, without the leaſt inconſiſtency; and who, poſſeſſed of all this genius and art, had, at
   the ſame time, the ſelf-denial of concealing himſelf, and of aſcribing his own works to an
   antiquated bard, without the impoſture being detected; is a ſuppoſition that tranſcends all
   bounds of credibility.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">There</span> are, beſides, two other circumſtances to be attended to, ſtill of
   greater weight, if poſſible, againſt this hypotheſis. One is, the total abſence of religious
   ideas from this work; for which the tranſlator has, in his preface, given a very probable
   account, on the footing of its being the work of Oſſian. The druidical ſuperſtition was, in the
   days of Oſſian, on the point of its final extinction; and, for particular reaſons, odious to the
   family of Fingal; whilſt the Chriſtian faith was not yet eſtabliſhed. But had it been the work of
   one to whom the ideas of Chriſtianity were familiar from his infancy, and who had ſuperadded to

   country, it is impoſſible. but in ſome paſſage or other, the traces of them would have appeared.
   The other circumſtance is, the entire ſilence which reigns with reſpect to all the great clans or
   families which are now eſtabliſhed in the Highlands. The origin of theſe ſeveral clans is known
   to be very ancient; and it is well known that there is no paſſion by which a native Highlander is
   more diſtinguiſhed than by attachment to his clan, and jealouſy for its honour. That a Highland
   bard, in forging a work relating to the antiquities of his country, ſhould have inſerted no
   circumſtance which pointed out the riſe of his own clan, which aſcertained its antiquity, or
   increaſed its glory, is, of all ſuppoſitions that can be formed, the moſt improbable; and the
   ſilence on this head amounts to a demonſtration that the author lived before any of the preſent
   great clans were formed or known.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Aſſuming</span> it then, as well we may, for certainty, that the poems, now under
   conſideration, are genuine venerable monuments of a very remote antiquity, I proceed to make ſome
   remarks upon their general ſpirit and ſtrain. The two great characteriſtics of Oſſian's poetry
   are, tenderneſs and ſublimity. It breathes nothing of the gay and cheerful kind; an air of
   ſolemnity
   <span class="page-number-image-wrapper"><span class="page-break">

   Oſſian is, perhaps, the only poet who never relaxes, or lets himſelf down into the light and
   amuſing ſtrain which I readily admit to be no ſmall diſadvantage to him, with the bulk of
   readers. He moves perpetually in the high region of the grand and the pathetic. One keynote is
   ſtruck at the beginning, and ſupported to the end; nor is any ornament introduced, but what is
   perfectly concordant with the general tone of melody. The events recorded, are all ſerious and
   grave; the ſcenery throughout, wild and romantic. The extended heath by the ſeaſhore; the
   mountains ſhaded with miſt; the torrent ruſhing through a ſolitary valley; the ſcattered oaks,
   and the tombs of warriors overgrown with moſs; all produce a ſolemn attention in the mind, and
   prepare it for great and extraordinary events. We find not in Oſſian an imagination that ſports
   itſelf, and dreſſes out gay trifles to pleaſe the fancy. His poetry, more perhaps than that of
   any other writer, deſerves to be ſtiled, <i>The poetry of the heart</i>. It is a heart
   penetrated with noble ſentiments and with ſublime and tender paſſions; a heart that glows, and
   kindles the fancy; a heart that is full, and pours itſelf forth. Oſſian did not write,, like
   modern poets, to pleaſe readers and critics. He ſung from the

His delight was to
   think of the heroes among whom he had flouriſhed; to recall the affecting incidents of his life;
   to dwell upon his paſt wars, and loves, and friendſhips: till, as he expreſſes it himſelf, “there
   comes a voice to Oſſian, and awakes his ſoul. It is the voice of years that are gone; they roll
   before me with all their deeds;” and under this true poetic inſpiration, giving vent to his
   genius, no wonder we ſhould ſo often hear, and acknowledge, in his ſtrains, the powerful and
   ever-pleaſing voice of nature.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">It</span> is neceſſary here to obſerve, that the beauties of Oſſian's writings
   cannot be felt by thoſe who have given them only a ſingle or haſty peruſal. His manner is ſo
   different from that of the poets to whom we are moſt accuſtomed; his ſtyle is ſo conciſe, and ſo
   much crowned with imagery; the mind is kept at ſuch a ſtretch in accompanying the author; that an
   ordinary reader is at firſt apt to be dazzled and fatigued, rather than pleaſed. His poems
   require to he taken up at intervals, and to be frequently reviewed; and then it is impoſſible but

Thoſe who have the higheſt
   degree of it will reliſh them the moſt.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">As</span> Homer is, of all the great poets, the one whoſe manner, and whoſe times,
   come the neareſt to Oſſian's, we are naturally led to run a parallel in ſome inſtances between
   the Greek and Celtic bard. For though Homer lived more than a thouſand years before Oſſian, it is
   not from the age of the world, but from the ſtate of ſociety that we are to judge of reſembling
   times. The Greek has, in ſeveral points, a manifeſt ſuperiority. He introduces a greater variety
   of incidents; he poſſeſſes a larger compaſs of ideas; has more diverſity in his characters; and a
   much deeper knowledge of human nature. It was not to be expected, that in any of theſe
   particulars Oſſian could equal Homer. For Homer lived in a country where ſociety was much farther
   advanced; he had beheld many more objects; cities built and flouriſhing; laws inſtituted; order,
   diſcipline, and arts, begun. His field of obſervation was much larger and more ſplendid: his
   knowledge, of courſe, more extenſive; his mind alſo, it ſhall be granted, more penetrating. But
   if Oſſian's ideas and objects be leſs diverſified than thoſe of Homer, they are all, however, of
   the kind fitteſt for poetry: the bravery and generoſity of heroes, the tenderneſs of lovers,

   children. In a rude age and country, though the events that happen be few, the undiſſipated mind
   broods over them more; they ſtrike the imagination, and fire the paſſions, in a higher degree;
   and, of conſequence, become happier materials to a poetical genius, than the ſame events when
   ſcattered through the wide circle of more varied action and cultivated life.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Homer</span> is a more cheerful and ſprightly poet than Oſſian. You diſcern in him
   all the Greek vivacity; whereas Oſſian uniformly maintains the gravity and ſolemnity of a Celtic
   hero. This, too, is in a great meaſure to be accounted for from the different ſituations in which
   they lived—partly perſonal, and partly national. Oſſian had ſurvived all his friends, and was
   diſpoſed to melancholy by the incidents of his life. But, beſides this, cheerfulneſs is one of
   the many bleſſings which we owe to formed ſociety. The ſolitary, wild ſtate, is always a ſerious
   one. Bating the ſudden and violent burſts of mirth, which ſometimes break forth at their dances
   and feaſts, the ſavage American tribes have been noted by all travellers for their gravity and
   taciturnity. Somewhat of this taciturnity may be alſo be remarked in Oſſian. On all occaſions he
   is frugal of his words; and never gives you more of an

   ſufficient to place it before you in one clear point of view. It is a blaze of lightning, which
   flaſhes and vaniſhes. Homer is more extended in his deſcriptions, and fills them up with a
   greater variety of circumſtances. Both the poets are dramatic; that is, they introduce their
   perſonages frequently ſpeaking before us. But Oſſian is conciſe and rapid in his ſpeeches, as he
   is in every other thing. Homer, with the Greek vivacity, had alſo ſome portion of the Greek
   loquacity. His ſpeeches, indeed, are highly characteriſtical; and to them we are much indebted
   for that admirable diſplay he has given of human nature. Yet, if he be tedious any where, it is
   in theſe: ſome of them are trifling, and ſome of them plainly unſeaſonable. Both poets are
   eminently ſublime; but a difference may be remarked in the ſpecies of their ſublimity. Homer's
   ſublimity is accompanied with more impetuoſity and fire; Oſſian's with more of a ſolemn and awful
   grandeur. Homer hurries you along; Oſſian elevates, and fixes you in aſtoniſhment. Homer is moſt
   ſublime in actions and battles; Oſſian in deſcription and ſentiment. In the pathetic, Homer, when
   he chooſes to exert it, has great power; but Oſſian exerts that power much oftener, and has the
   character of tenderneſs far

No poet
   knew better how to ſeize and melt the heart. With regard to dignity of ſentiment, the
   pre-eminence muſt clearly he given to Oſſian. This is, indeed, a ſurpriſing circumſtance, that in
   point of humanity, magnanimity, virtuous feelings of every kind, our rude Celtic bard ſhould be
   diſtinguiſhed to ſuch a degree, that not only the heroes of Homer, but even thoſe of the polite
   and refined Virgil, are left far behind by thoſe of Oſſian.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">After</span> theſe general obſervations on the genius and ſpirit of our author, I
   now proceed to a nearer view and more accurate examination of his works; and as Fingal is the
   firſt great poem in this collection, it is proper to begin with it. To refuſe the title of an
   epic poem to Fingal, becauſe it is not, in every little particular, exactly conformable to the
   practice of Homer and Virgil, were the mere ſqueamiſhneſs and pedantry of criticiſm. Examined
   even according to Ariſtotle's rules, it will be found to have all the eſſential requiſites of a
   true and regular epic; and to have ſeveral of them in ſo high a degree, as at firſt view to raiſe
   our aſtoniſhment on finding Oſſian's compoſition ſo agreeable to rules of which he was entirely
   ignorant. But our aſtoniſhment will ceaſe, when we conſider

   Homer knew no more of the laws of criticiſm than Oſſian. But, guided by nature, he compoſed in
   verſe a regular ſtory, founded on heroic actions, which all poſterity admired. Ariſtotle, with
   great ſagacity and penetration, traced the cauſes of this general admiration. He obſerved what it
   was in Homer's compoſition, and in the conduct of his ſtory, which gave it ſuch power to pleaſe;
   from. this obſervation he deduced the rules which poets ought to follow, who would write and
   pleaſe like Homer; and to a compoſition formed according to ſuch rules, he gave the name of an
   epic poem. Hence his whole ſyſtem aroſe. Ariſtotle ſtudied nature in Homer. Homer and Oſſian both
   wrote from nature. No wonder that among all the three, there ſhould be ſuch agreement and
   conformity.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> fundamental rules delivered by Ariſtotle concerning an epic poem, are
   theſe: that the action, which is the groundwork of the poem, ſhould be one, complete, and great;
   that it ſhould be feigned, not merely hiſtorical; that it ſhould be enlivened with characters and
   manners, and heightened by the marvellous.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span>, before entering on any of theſe, it may perhaps be aſked, what is the
   moral of Fingal? For, according to M. Boſſu, an epic poem is

   illuſtrate ſome, moral truth. The poet, ſays this critic, muſt begin with fixing on ſome maxim or
   inſtruction, which he intends to inculcate on mankind. He next forms a fable, like one of Æſop's,
   wholly with a view to the moral; and having thus ſettled and arranged his plan, he then looks
   into traditionary hiſtory for names and incidents, to give his fable ſome air of probability.
   Never did a more frigid, pedantic notion enter into the mind of a critic. We may ſafely
   pronounce, that he who ſhould compoſe an epic poem after this manner, who ſhould firſt lay down a
   moral and contrive a plan, before he had thought of his perſonages and actors, might deliver,
   indeed, very ſound inſtruction, but would find very few readers. There cannot be the leaſt doubt
   that the firſt object which ſtrikes an epic poet, which fires his genius, and gives him any idea
   of his work, is the action or ſubject he is to celebrate. Hardly is there any tale, any ſubject,
   a poet can chooſe for ſuch a work, but will afford ſome general moral inſtruction. An epic poem
   is, by its nature, one of the moſt moral of all poetical compoſitions: but its moral tendency is
   by no means to be limited to ſome commonplace maxim, which may be gathered from the ſtory. It
   ariſes from the admiration of heroic actions,

   calculated to produce; from the virtuous emotions which the characters and incidents raiſe,
   whilſt we read it; from the happy impreſſions which all the parts ſeparately, as well as the
   whole together, leave upon the mind. However, if a general moral be ſtill inſiſted on, Fingal
   obviouſly furniſhes one, not inferior to that of any other poet, viz: that wiſdom and bravery
   always triumph over brutal force: or another, nobler ſtill: that the moſt complete victory over
   an enemy is obtained by that moderation and generoſity which convert him into a friend.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> unity of the epic action, which of all Ariſtotle's rules, is the chief
   and moſt material, is ſo ſtrictly preſerved in Fingal, that it muſt be perceived by every reader.
   It is a more complete unity than what ariſes from relating the actions of one man, which the
   Greek critic juſtly cenſures as imperfect: it is the unity of one enterpriſe—the deliverance of
   Ireland from the invaſion of Swaran; an enterpriſe which has ſurely the full heroic dignity. All
   the incidents recorded bear a conſtant reference to one end; no double plot is carried on; but
   the pa unite into a regular whole; and as the action is one and great, ſo it is an entire or
   complete action. For we find, as the critic, farther

   a nodus, or intrigue, in the poem; difficulties occurring through Cuthullin's raſhneſs and bad
   ſucceſs; thoſe difficulties gradually ſurmounted; and at laſt, the work conducted to that happy
   concluſion which is held eſſential to epic poetry. Unity is, indeed, obſerved with greater
   exactneſs in Fingal, than in almoſt any other epic compoſition. For not only is unity of ſubject
   maintained, but that of time and place alſo. The autumn is clearly pointed out as the ſeaſon of
   the action; and from beginning to end the ſcene is never ſhifted from the heath of Lena, along
   the ſeaſhore. The duration of the action in Fingal, is much ſhorter than in the Iliad or Æneid;
   but ſure there may be ſhorter as well longer heroic poems; and if the authority of Ariſtotle be
   alſo required for this, he ſays expreſſly, that the epic compoſition is indefinite as to the time
   of its duration. Accordingly, the action of the Iliad laſts only forty-ſeven days, whilſt that of
   the Æneid is continued for more than a year.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Throughout</span> the whole of Fingal, there reigns that grandeur of ſentiment,

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">He</span> invokes no muſe, for he acknowledged none. but his occaſional addreſſes
   to Malvina have a finer effect than the invocation of any muſe. He ſets out with no formal
   propoſition of his ſubject; but the ſubject naturally and eaſily unfolds itſelf; the poem opening
   in an animated manner, with the ſituation of Cuthullin, and the arrival of a ſcout, who informs
   him of Swaran's landing. Mention is preſently made of Fingal, and of the expected aſſiſtance from
   the ſhips of the lonely iſle, in order to give farther light to the ſubject. For the poet often
   ſhews his addreſs in gradually preparing us for the events he is to introduce; and, in

   poet of the moſt refined times. Homer's art in magnifying the character of Achilles, has been
   univerſally admired. Oſſian certainly ſhews no leſs aft in aggrandizing Fingal. Nothing could be
   more happily imagined for this purpoſe than the whole management of the laſt battle, wherein
   Gaul, the ſon of Morni, had beſought Fingal to retire, and to leave him and his other chiefs the
   honour of the day. The generoſity of the king in agreeing to this propoſal; the majeſty with
   which he retreats to the hill, from whence he was to behold the engagement, attended by his
   bards, and waving the lightning of his ſword; his perceiving the chiefs overpowered by numbers,
   but, from unwillingneſs to deprive them of the glory of victory by coming in perſon to their
   aſſiſtance, firſt ſending Ullin, the bard, to animate their courage, and at laſt, when the danger
   becomes more preſſing, his riſing in his might, and interpoſing, like a divinity, to decide the
   doubtful fate of the day; are all circumſtances contrived with ſo much art, as plainly diſcover
   the Celtic bards to have been not unpractiſed in heroic poetry.</p>

   concerning a female ſlave; on which Achilles, apprehending himſelf to be injured, withdraws his
   aſſiſtance from the reſt of the Greeks. The Greeks fall into great diſtreſs, and beſeech him to
   be reconciled to them. He refuſes to fight for them in perſon, but ſends his friend Patroclus;
   and upon his being ſlain, goes forth to revenge his death, and kills Hector. The ſubject of
   Fingal is this: Swaran comes to invade Ireland; Cuthullin, the guardian of the young king, had
   applied for his aſſiſtance to Fingal, who reigned in the oppoſite coaſt of Scotland. But before
   Fingal's arrival, he is hurried by raſh counſel to encounter Swaran. He is defeated; he retreats,
   and deſponds. Fingal arrives in this conjuncture. The battle is for ſome time dubious; but in the
   end he conquers Swaran; and the remembrance of Swaran's being the brother of Agandecca, who, had
   once ſaved his life, makes him diſmiſs him honourably. Homer, it is true, has filled up his ſtory
   with a much greater variety of particulars than Oſſian; and in this has ſhown a compaſs of
   invention ſuperior to that of the other poet. But it muſt not be forgotten that though Homer be
   more circumſtantial, his incidents, however, are leſs diverſified in kind than thoſe of Oſſian.

   notwithſtanding all the fertility of Homer's invention, there is ſo much uniformity in his
   ſubjects, that there are few readers, who, before the cloſe, are not tired with perpetual
   fighting. Whereas in Oſſian, the mind is relieved by a more agreeable diverſity. There is a finer
   mixture of war and heroiſm, with love and friendſhip—of martial, with tender ſcones, than is to
   be met with, perhaps, in any other poet. The epiſodes, too, have great propriety—as natural, and
   proper to that age and country: conſiſting of the ſongs of bards, which are known to have been
   the great entertainment of the Celtic heroes in war, as well as in peace. Theſe ſongs are not
   introduced at random; if you except the epiſode of Duchommar and Morna, in the firſt book, which,
   though beautiful, is more unartful than any of the reſt, they have always ſome particular
   relation to the actor who is intereſted, or to the events which are going on; and, whilſt they
   vary the ſcene, they preſerve a ſufficient connection with the main ſubject by the fitneſs and
   propriety of their introduction.</p>

But as it lay
   without the compaſs of the preſent action, it could be regularly introduced nowhere except in an
   epiſode. Accordingly, the poet, with as much propriety as if Ariſtotle himſelf had directed the
   plan, has contrived an epiſode for this purpoſe in the ſong of Carril, at the beginning of the
   third book.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> concluſion of the poem is ſtrictly according to rule, and is every way
   noble and pleaſing. Th reconciliation of the contending heroes, the conſolation of Cuthullin, and
   the general felicity that crowns the action, ſoothe the mind in a very agreeable manner, and form
   that paſſage from agitation and trouble, to perfect quiet and repoſe, which critics require as
   the proper termination of the epic work. “Thus they paſſed the night in ſong, and brought back
   the morning with joy. Fingal aroſe on the heath; and ſhook his glittering ſpear in his hand. He
   moved firſt towards the plains of Lena; and we followed like a ridge of fire. Spread the ſail,
   ſaid the king of Morven, and catch the winds that pour from Lena. We roſe on the waves with
   ſongs; and ruſhed with joy through the foam of the ocean.” So much for the unity and general
   conduct of the Epic action in Fingal.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">With</span> regard to that property of the ſubject which Ariſtotle requires, that
   it ſhould be feigned, not hiſtorical, he muſt not be underſtood ſo ſtrictly is if he meant to
   exclude all ſubjects which have any foundation in truth. For ſuch excluſion would both be
   unreaſonable in itſelf, and what is more, would be contrary to the practice of Homer, who is
   known to have founded his Iliad on hiſtorical facts concerning the war of Troy, which was famous
   throughout all Greece. Ariſtotle means no more than that it is the buſineſs of a poet not to be a
   more annaliſt of facts, but to embelliſh truth with beautiful, probable, and uſeful fictions; to
   copy nature as he himſelf explains it, like painters, who preſerve a likeneſs, but exhibit their
   objects more grand and beautiful than they are in reality. That Oſſian has followed this courſe,
   and building upon true hiſtory, has ſufficiently adorned it with poetical fiction for
   aggrandizing his characters and facts, will not, I believe, be queſtioned by moſt readers. At the
   ſame time, the foundation which thoſe facts and characters had in truth, and the ſhare which the
   poet had himſelf in the tranſactions which he records, muſt be conſidered as no ſmall advantage

   events ſo feelingly as thoſe in which he has been intereſted; paints any ſcene ſo naturally as
   one which he has ſeen; or draws any characters in ſuch ſtrong colours as thoſe which he has
   perſonally known. It is conſidered as an advantage of the epic ſubject to be taken from a period
   ſo diſtant, as, by being involved in the darkneſs of tradition, may give licenſe to fable. Though
   Oſſian's ſubject may at firſt view appear unfavourable in this reſpect, as being taken from his
   own times, yet, when we reflect that he lived to an extreme old age; that he relates what had
   been tranſacted in another country, at the diſtance of many years, and after all that race of men
   who had been the actors were gone off the ſtage; we ſhall find the objection in a great meaſure
   obviated. In ſo rude an age, when no written records were known, when tradition was looſe, and
   accuracy of any kind little attended to, what was great and heroic in one generation, eaſily
   ripened into the marvellous in the next.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> natural repreſentation of human character in an epic poem is highly

   ſuperior to Virgil; and has, indeed, given all the diſplay of human nature, which the ſimple
   occurrences of his times could be expected to furniſh. No dead uniformity of character prevails
   in Fingal; but, on the contrary, the principal characters are not only clearly diſtinguiſhed, but
   ſometimes artfully contraſted, ſo as to illuſtrate each other. Oſſian's heroes are like Homer's,
   all brave; but their bravery, like thoſe of Homer's too, is of different kinds. For inſtance: the
   prudent, the ſedate, the modeſt and circumſpect Connal, is finely oppoſed to the preſumptuous,
   raſh, overbearing, but gallant and generous Calmar. Calmar hurries Cuthullin into action by his
   temerity; and when he ſees the bad effects of his counſels, he will not ſurvive the diſgrace.
   Connal, like another Ulyſſes, attends Cuthullin to his retreat, counſels and comforts him under
   his miſfortune. The fierce, the proud, and the high-ſpirited Swaran, is admirably contraſted with
   the calm, the moderate, and generous Fingal. The character of Oſcar is a favourite one throughout
   the whole poems. The amiable warmth of the young warrior; his eager impetuoſity in the day of
   action; his paſſion for fame; his ſubmiſſion to his father; his tenderneſs for Malvina; are the
   ſtrokes of a maſterly

   hand of nature, and attracts the heart. Oſſian's own character, the old man, the hero, and the
   bard, all in one, preſents to us, through the whole work, a moſt reſpectable and venerable
   figure, which we always contemplate with pleaſure. Cuthullin is a hero of the higheſt claſs:
   daring, magnanimous, and exquiſitely ſenſible to honour. We become attached to his intereſt, and
   are deeply touched with his diſtreſs; and after the admiration raiſed for him in the firſt part
   of the poem, it is a ſtrong proof of Oſſian's maſterly genius, that he durſt adventure to produce
   to us another hero, compared with whom, even the great Cuthullin ſhould be only an inferior
   perſonage; and who ſhould riſe as far above him, as Cuthullin riſes above the reſt.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Here</span> indeed, in the character and deſcription of Fingal, Oſſian triumphs
   almoſt unrivalled; for we may boldly defy all antiquity to ſhow us any hero equal to Fingal.
   Homer's Hector poſſeſſes ſeveral great and amiable qualities; but Hector is a ſecondary perſonage
   in the Iliad, not the hero of the work. We ſee him only occaſionally; we know much leſs of him
   than we do of Fingal; who, not only in this, epic poem, but in Temora, and throughout the reſt of
   Oſſian's works, is preſented in all that variety of

   character. And though Hector faithfully diſcharges his duty to his country, his friends, and his
   family, he is tinctured, however, with a degree of the ſame ſavage ferocity which prevails among
   all the Homeric heroes: for we find him inſulting over the fallen Patroclus with the moſt cruel
   taunts, and telling him, when he lies in the agonies of death, that Achilles cannot help him now;
   and that in a ſhort time his body, ſtripped naked, and deprived of funeral honours, ſhall be

   all the qualities that can ennoble human nature; that can either make us admire the hero, or love
   the man. He is not only unconquerable in war, but he makes his people happy by his wiſdom in the
   days of peace. He is truly too father of his people. He is known by the epithet or “Fingal of the
   mildeſt look;” and diſtinguiſhed on every occaſion by humanity and generoſity. He is merciful to

   friends; and never mentions Agandecca, his firſt love, without the utmoſt tenderneſs. He is the
   univerſal Protector of the diſtreſſed; “None ever went ſad from Fingal.”—“O, Oſcar! bend the
   ſtrong in arms; but ſpare the feeble hand. Be thou a ſtream of mighty tides againſt the foes of
   thy people; but like the gale that moves the graſs to thoſe who aſk thine aid. So Trenmor lived;
   ſuch Trathal was; and ſuch has Fingal been. My arm was the ſupport of the injured; the weak
   reſted behind the lightning of my ſteel.” Theſe were the maxims of true heroiſm, to which he
   formed his grandſon. His fame is repreſented as everywhere ſpread; the greateſt heroes
   acknowledge his ſuperiority; his enemies tremble at his name; and the higheſt encomium that can
   be beſtowed on one whom the poets would moſt exalt, is to ſay, that his ſoul was like the ſoul of
   Fingal.</p>

   difficult, than to draw a perfect character in ſuch a manner as to render it diſtinct, and
   affecting to the mind. Some ſtrokes of human imperfection and frailty, are what uſually give us
   the moſt clear view, and the moſt ſenſible impreſſion of a character; becauſe they preſent to us
   a man, ſuch as we have ſeen; they recall known features of human nature. When poets attempt to go
   beyond this range, and deſcribe a faultleſs hero, they for the moſt part ſet before us a ſort of
   vague, undiſtinguiſhable character, ſuch as the imagination cannot lay hold of, or realize to
   itſelf as the object of affection. We know how much Virgil has failed in this particular. His
   perfect hero, Æneas, is an unanimated, inſipid perſonage, whom we may pretend to admire, but whom
   no one can heartily love. But what Virgil has failed in, Oſſian, to our aſtoniſhment, has
   ſucceſſfully executed. His Fingal, though exhibited without any of the common human failings, is,
   nevertheleſs, a real man; a character which touches and intereſts every reader. To this it has
   much contributed that the poet has repreſented him as an old man; and by this has gained the
   advantage of throwing around him a great many circumſtances, peculiar to that age, which paint
   him to the fancy in a more diſtinct

He is ſurrounded with his family; he
   inſtructs his children in the principles of virtue; he is narrative of his paſt exploits he is
   venerable with the gray locks of age; he is frequently diſpoſed to moralize, like an old man, on
   human vanity, and the proſpect of death. There is more art, at leaſt more felicity, in this, than
   may at firſt be imagined. For youth and old are the two ſtates of human life, capable of being
   placed in the moſt pictureſque lights. Middle age is more general and vague; and has fewer
   circumſtances peculiar to the idea of it. And when any object is in a ſituation that admits it to
   be rendered particular, and to be clothed with a variety of circumſtances, it always ſtands out
   more clear and full of poetical deſcription.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Beſides</span> human perſonages, divine or ſupernatural agents are often introduced
   into epic poetry, forming what is called the machinery of it; which moſt critics hold to be an
   eſſential part. The marvellous, it muſt he admitted, has always a great charm for the bulk of
   readers. It gratifies the imagination, and affords room for ſtriking and ſublime deſcription. No
   wonder, therefore, that all poets ſhould have a ſtrong propenſity towards it. But I muſt obſerve,
   that nothing is more difficult than to adjuſt properly the marvellous with the probable. If a

   with extravagant ſupernatural ſcenes, he ſpreads over it an appearance of romance and childiſh
   fiction; he tranſports his readers from this world into a fantaſtic viſionary region; and loſes
   that weight and dignity which ſhould reign in epic poetry. No work from which probability is
   altogether baniſhed, can make a laſting or deep impreſſion. Human actions and manners are always,
   the moſt intereſting objects which can be preſented to a human mind. All machinery, therefore, is
   faulty, which withdraws theſe too much from view, or obſcures them under a cloud of incredible
   fictions. Beſides being temperately employed, machinery ought always to have ſome foundation in
   popular belief. A poet is by no means at liberty to invent what ſyſtem of the marvellous he
   pleaſes; he muſt avail himſelf either of the religious faith, or the ſuperſtitious credulity of
   the country wherein he lives; ſo as to give an air of probability to events which are moſt
   contrary to the common courſe of nature.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> theſe reſpects, Oſſian appears to me to have been remarkably happy. He
   has, indeed, followed the ſame courſe with Homer. For it is perfectly abſurd to imagine, as ſome
   critics have done, that Homer's mythology was invented by

   on the benefits it would yield to poetry.” Homer was no ſuch refining genius. He found the
   traditionary ſtories, on which he built his Iliad, mingled with popular legends concerning the
   intervention of the gods; and he adopted theſe becauſe they amuſed the fancy. Oſſian, in like
   manner, found the tales of his country full of ghoſts and ſpirits; it is likely he believed them
   himſelf; and he introduced them, becauſe they gave his poems that ſolemn and marvellous caſt
   which ſuited his genius. This was the only machinery he could employ with propriety; becauſe it
   was the only intervention of ſupernatural beings which agreed with the common belief of the
   country. It was happy; becauſe it did not interfere in the leaſt with the proper diſplay of human
   characters and actions; becauſe it had leſs of the incredible than moſt other kinds of poetical
   machinery; and becauſe it ſerved to diverſify the ſcene, and to heighten the ſubject by an awful
   grandeur, which is the great deſign of machinery.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">As</span> Oſſian's mythology is peculiar to himſelf, and makes a conſiderable
   figure in his other poems, as well as in Fingal, it may be proper to make ſome obſervations on
   it, independent of its ſubſerviency to epic compoſition. It turns

   departed ſpirits. Theſe, conſonantly to the notions of every rude age, are repreſented not as
   purely immaterial, but as thin airy forms, which can be viſible or inviſible at pleaſure; their
   voice is feeble, their arm is weak; but they are endowed with knowledge more than human. In a
   ſeparate ſtate, they retain the ſame diſpoſitions which animated them in this life. They ride on
   the wind; they bend their airy bows; and purſue deer formed of clouds. The ghoſts of departed
   bards continue to ſing. The ghoſts of departed heroes frequent the fields of their former fame.
   “They reſt together in their caves, and talk of mortal men. Their ſongs are of other worlds. They
   come ſometimes to the ear of reſt, and raiſe their feeble voice.” All this preſents to us much
   the ſame ſet of ideas concerning ſpirits, as we find in the eleventh book of the Odyſſey, where
   Ulyſſes viſits the regions of the dead; and in the twenty-third book of the Iliad, the ghoſt of
   Patroclus, after appearing to Achilles, vaniſhes preciſely like one of Oſſian's, emitting a
   ſhrill, feeble cry, and melting away like ſmoke.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> though Homer's and Oſſian's ideas concerning ghoſts were of the ſame
   nature, we cannot but obſerve, that Oſſian's ghoſts are drawn with much ſtronger and livelier

Oſſian deſcribes ghoſts
   with all the particularity of one who had ſeen and converſed with them, and whoſe imagination was
   full of the impreſſion they had left upon it. He calls up thoſe awful and tremendous ideas which
   the <span class="quote">
   <span class="line">—Simulacra modis pallentia miris</span> </span> are fitted to raiſe in the human mind; and
   which, in Shakſpeare's ſtyle, “harrow up the ſoul.” Crugal's ghoſt, in particular, in the
   beginning of the ſecond book of Fingal, may vie with any appearance of this kind, deſcribed by
   any epic or tragic poet whatever. Moſt poets would have contented themſelves, with telling us,
   that he reſembled, in every particular, the living Crugal; that his form and dreſs were the ſame,
   only his face more pale and ſad; and that he bore the mark of the wound by which he fell. But
   Oſſian ſets before our eyes a ſpirit from the inviſible world, diſtinguiſhed by all thoſe
   features which a ſtrong, aſtoniſhed imagination would give to a ghoſt. “A dark red ſtream of fire
   comes down from the hill. Crugal ſat upon the beam; he that lately fell by the band of Swaran,
   ſtriving in the battle of heroes. His face is like the beam of the ſetting moon. His robes are of

His eyes are like two decaying
   flames. Dark is the wound of his breaſt.—The ſtars dim twinkled through his form; and his voice
   was like the ſound of a diſtant ſtream.” The circumſtance of the ſtars being beheld “dim
   twinkling through his form,” is wonderfully pictureſque, and convoys the moſt lively impreſſion
   of his thin and ſhadowy ſubſtance. The attitude in which he is afterward placed, and the ſpeech
   put into his mouth, are full of that ſolemn and awful ſublimity, which ſuits the ſubject. “Dim,
   and in tears he ſtood, and he ſtretched his pale hand over the hero. Faintly he raiſed his feeble
   voice, like the gale of the reedy Lego.—My ghoſt, O Connal! is on my native hills; but my corſe
   is on the ſands of Ulla. Thou ſhalt never talk with Crugal, or find his lone ſteps in the heath.
   I am light as the blaſt of Cromla; and I move like the ſhadow of miſt. Connal, ſon of Colgar! I
   ſee the dark cloud of death; it hovers over the plains of Lena. The ſons of green Erin Shall
   fall. Remove from the field of ghoſts.—Like the darkened moon, he retired in the midſt of the
   whiſtling blaſt.”</p>

   ſcenery always ſuited to the occaſion. “Oſcar ſlowly aſcends the hill. The meteors of night ſet
   on the heath before him. A diſtant torrent faintly roars. Unfrequent blaſts ruſh through aged
   oaks. The half enlightened moon ſinks dim and red behind her hill. Feeble voices are heard on the
   heath. Oſcar drew his ſword—.”Nothing can prepare the fancy more happily for the awful ſcene that
   is to follow. “Trenmor came from his hill at the voice of his mighty ſon. A cloud, like the ſteed
   of the ſtranger, ſupported his airy limbs. His robe is of the miſt of Lano, that brings death to
   the people. His ſword is a green meteor, half extinguiſhed. His face is without form, and dark.
   He ſighed thrice over the hero; and thrice the winds of the night roared around. Many were his
   words to Oſcar.—He ſlowly vaniſhed, like a miſt that melts on the ſunny hill.” To appearances of
   this kind, we can find no parallel among the Greek or Roman poets. They bring to mind that noble
   deſcription in the book of Job: “In thoughts from the viſion of the night, when deep ſleep
   falleth on men, fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to ſhake. Then a ſpirit

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">As</span> Oſſian's ſupernatural beings are deſcribed with a ſurpriſing force of
   imagination, ſo they are introduced with propriety. We have only three ghoſts in Fingal: that of
   Crugal, which comes to warn the hoſt of impending deſtruction, and to adviſe them to ſave
   themſelves by retreat; that of Evir-allen, the ſpouſe of Oſſian, which calls on him to riſe and
   reſcue their ſon from danger; and that of Agandecca, which, juſt before the laſt engagement with
   Swaran, moves Fingal to pity, by mourning for the approaching deſtruction of her kinſman and
   people. In the other poems, ghoſts ſometimes appear, when invoked, to foretell futurity;
   frequently, according to the notions of theſe times, they come as forerunners of miſfortune or
   death, to thoſe whom they viſit; ſometimes they inform their friends at a diſtance of thier own
   death; and ſometimes they are introduced to heighten the ſcenery on ſome great and ſolemn
   occaſion.

   faces of other times looked from the clouds of Crona.”—“Fercuth! I ſaw the ghoſt of night. Silent

   after the ſuperſtitions have paſſed away on which it is founded. Oſſian's mythology is, to ſpeak
   ſo, the mythology of human nature; for it is founded on what has been the popular belief, in all

The indecent ſquabbles among his
   gods ſurely do no honour to epic poetry. Whereas Oſſian's machinery has dignity upon all
   occaſions. It is indeed a dignity of the dark and awful kind; but this is proper; becauſe
   coincident with the ſtrain and ſpirit of the poetry. A light and gay mythology, like Homer's,
   would have been perfectly unſuitable to the ſubjects on which Oſſian's genius was employed. But
   though his machinery be always ſolemn, it is not, however, always dreary or diſmal; it as
   enlivened, as much as the ſubject would permit, by thoſe pleaſant and beautiful appearances,
   which he ſometimes introduces, of the ſpirits of the hill. Theſe are gentle ſpirits: deſcending
   on ſunbeams, fair moving on the plain; their forms white and bright; their voices ſweet; and
   their viſits to men propitious. The greateſt praiſe that can be given to the beauty of a living
   woman, is to ſay, “She is fair as the ghoſt of the hill, when it moves in a ſunbeam at noon, over
   the ſilence of Morven.” “The hunter ſhall hear my voice from his booth. He ſhall fear, but love

   perfectly conſonant, not only to the peculiar ideas of northern nations, but to the general
   current of a ſuperſtitious mention in all countries. The deſcription of Fingal's airy hall, in
   the poem called Errathon, and of the aſcent of Malvina into it, deſerves particular notice, as
   remarkably noble and magnificent. But, above all, the engagement of Fingal with the ſpirit of
   Loda, in Carric-thura, cannot be mentioned without admiration. I forbear tranſcribing the
   paſſage, as it muſt have drawn the attention of every one who has read the works of Oſſian. The
   undaunted courage of Fingal, oppoſed to all the terrors of the Scandinavian god; the appearance
   and the ſpeech of that awful ſpirit; the wound which he receives, and the ſhriek which he ſends

   author. The fiction is calculated to aggrandize the hero; which it does to a high degree: nor is
   it ſo unnatural or wild a fiction as might at firſt be thought. According to the notions of thoſe
   times, ſupernatural beings were material, and, conſequently, vulnerable. The ſpirit of Loda was
   not acknowledged as a deity by Fingal; he did not worſhip at the ſtone of his power; he plainly
   conſidered him as the god of his enemies only; as a local deity, whoſe dominion extended no
   farther than to the regions where he was worſhipped; who had, therefore, no title to threaten
   him, and no claim to his ſubmiſſion. We know there are poetical precedents of great authority,
   for fictions fully as extravagant; and if Homer be forgiven for making Diomed attack and wound in
   battle the gods whom that chief himſelf worſhipped, Oſſian ſurely is pardonable for making his

   machinery, I acknowledge it would have been much more beautiful and perfect had the author
   diſcovered ſome knowledge of a Supreme Being. Although his ſilence on this head has been
   accounted for by the learned and ingenious tranſlator in a very probable, manner, yet ſtill it
   muſt be held a conſiderable diſadvantage to the poetry. For the moſt auguſt and lofty ideas that
   can embelliſh poetry are derived from the belief of a divine adminiſtration of the univerſe; and
   hence the invocation of a Supreme Being, or at leaſt of ſome ſuperior powers, who are conceived
   as preſiding over human affairs, the ſolemnities of religious worſhip, prayers preferred, and
   aſſiſtance implored on critical occaſions, appear

   all poets, as chief ornaments of their compoſitions. The abſence of all ſuch religious ideas from
   Oſſian's poetry is a ſenſible blank in it; the more to be regretted, as we can eaſily imagine
   what an illuſtrious figure they would have made under the management of ſuch a genius as his; and
   how finely they would have been adapted to many ſituations which occur in his works.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">After</span> ſo particular an examination of Fingal, it were needleſs to enter into
   as full a diſcuſſion of the conduct of Temora, the other epic poem. Many of the ſame
   obſervations, eſpecially with regard to the great characteriſtics of heroic poetry, apply to
   both. The high merit, however, of Temora, requires that we ſhould not paſs it by without ſome
   remarks.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſcene of Temora, as of Fingal, is laid in Ireland; and the action is of
   a poſterior date. The ſubject is, an expedition of the hero to dethrone and puniſh a bloody
   uſurper, and to reſtore the poſſeſſion of the kingdom to the poſterity of the lawful prince: an
   undertaking worthy of the juſtice and heroiſm of the great Fingal. The action is one, and
   complete. The Poem opens with the deſcent of Fingal on the coaſt, and the conſultation held among
   the chiefs of the enemy. The murder of the young

   war, being antecedent to the epic action, is introduced with great propriety as an epiſode in the
   firſt book. In the progreſs of the poem, three battles are deſcribed, which riſe in their
   importance above, one another; the ſucceſs is various, and the iſſue for ſome time doubtful; till
   at laſt, Fingal, brought into diſtreſs, by the wound of his great general Gaul, and the death of
   his ſon Fillan, aſſumes the command himſelf; and, having ſlain the Iriſh king in ſingle combat,
   reſtores the rightful heir to his throne.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Temora</span> has perhaps leſs fire than the other epic poem; but in return it has
   more variety, more tenderneſs, and more magnificence. The reigning idea, ſo often reſented to us,
   of “Fingal, in the laſt of his fields, is venerable and affecting; nor could any more noble
   concluſion be thought of, than the aged hero, after ſo many ſucceſſful achievements, taking his
   leave of battles, and, with all the ſolemnities of thoſe times, reſigning his ſpear to his ſon.
   The events are leſs crowded in Temora than in Fingal; actions and characters are more
   particularly diſplayed: we are let into the tranſactions of both hoſts, and informed of the
   adventures of the night as well as of the day. The ſtill, pathetic, and the romantic ſcenery of

   Oſſian's genius, occaſion a fine diverſity in the poem; and are happily contraſted with the
   military operations of the day.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> moſt of our author's poems, the horrors of war are ſoftened by intermixed
   ſcenes of love and friendſhip. In Fingal theſe are introduced as epiſodes: in Temora we have an
   incident of this nature wrought into the body of the piece, in the adventure of Cathmor and
   Sulmalla. This forms one of the moſt conſpicuous beauties of that poem. The diſtreſs of Sulmalla,
   diſguiſed and unknown amongſt ſtrangers, her tender and anxious concern for the ſafety of
   Cathmor, her dream, and her melting remembrance of the land of her fathers; Cathmor's emotion
   when he firſt diſcovers her, his ſtruggles to conceal and ſuppreſs his paſſion, leſt it ſhould
   unman him in the midſt of war, though “his ſoul poured forth in ſecret, when he beheld her
   fearful eye,” and the laſt interview between them, when, overcome by her tenderneſs, he lets her
   know he had diſcovered her, and confeſſes his paſſion; are all wrought up with the moſt exquiſite
   ſenſibility and delicacy.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Beſides</span> the characters which appeared in Fingal, ſeveral new ones are here
   introduced; and though, as they are all the characters of

   feature, they are nevertheleſs diverſified in a ſenſible and ſtriking manner. Foldath, for
   inſtance, the general of Cathmor, exhibits the perfect picture of a ſavage chieftain; bold and
   daring, but preſumptuous, cruel, and overbearing. He is diſtinguiſhed, on his firſt appearance,
   as the friend of the tyrant Cairbar, “His ſtride is haughty; his red eye rolls in wrath.” In his
   perſon and whole deportment he is contraſted with the mild and wiſe Hidalla, another leader of
   the ſame army, on whoſe humanity and gentleneſs he looks with great contempt. He profeſſedly
   delights in ſtrife and blood. He inſults over the fallen. He is imperious in his counſels, and
   factious when they are not followed. He is unrelenting in all his ſchemes of revenge, even to the
   length of denying the funeral ſong to the dead; which, from the injury thereby done to their
   ghoſts, was in thoſe days conſidered as the greateſt barbarity. Fierce to the laſt, he comforts
   himſelf in his dying moments with thinking that his ghoſt ſhall often leave its blaſt to rejoice
   over the graves of thoſe he had ſlain. Yet Oſſian, ever prone to the pathetic, has contrived to
   throw into his account of the death, even of this man, ſome tender
   <span class="page-number-image-wrapper"><span class="page-break">

   his daughter Dardulena, the laſt of his race.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> character of Foldath tends much to exalt that of Cathmor, the chief
   commander, which is diſtinguiſhed by the moſt humane virtues. He all fraud and cruelty, is famous
   for his hoſpitality to ſtrangers; open to every generous ſentiment, and to every ſoft and
   compaſſionate feeling. he is ſo amiable as to divide the reader's attachment between him and the
   hero of the poem; though our author has artfully managed it ſo as to make Cathmor himſelf
   indirectly acknowledge Fingal's ſuperiority, and to appear ſomewhat apprehenſive of the event,
   after the death of Fillan, which he knew would call forth Fingal in all his might. It is very
   remarkable, that although Oſſian has introduced into his poems three complete heroes, Cuthullin,
   Cathmor, and Fingal, he has, however, ſenſibly diſtinguiſhed each of their characters; Cuthullin
   is particularly honourable; Cathmor particularly amiable; Fingal wiſe and great, retaining an
   aſcendant peculiar to himſelf in whatever light he is viewed.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> the favourite figure in Temora, and the one moſt highly finiſhed, is
   Fillan. His character is of that ſort for which Oſſian ſhews a

   young warrior, fired with all the impatient enthuſiaſm for military glory peculiar to that time
   of life. He had ſketched this in the deſcription of his own ſon Oſcar; but as he has extended it
   more fully in Fillan, and as the character is ſo conſonant to the epic ſtrain, though, as far as
   I remember, not placed in ſuch a conſpicuous light by any other epic poet, it may be worth while
   to attend a little to Oſſian's management of it in this inſtance.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Fillan</span> was the youngeſt of all the ſons of Fingal younger, it is plain, than
   his nephew Oſcar, by whoſe fame and great deeds in war we may naturally ſuppoſe his ambition to
   have been highly ſtimulated. Withal, as lie is younger, he is deſcribed as more raſh and fiery.
   His firſt appearance is ſoon after Oſcar's death, when he was employed to watch the motions of
   the foe by night. In a converſation with his brother Oſſian, on that occaſion, we learn that it
   was not long ſince he began to lift the ſpear. “Few are the marks of my ſword in battle; but my
   ſoul is fire.” He is with ſome difficulty reſtrained by Oſſian from going to attack the enemy;
   and complains to him, that his father had never allowed him any opportunity of ſignalizing his
   valor. “The king hath not

   crowd; I return without my fame.” Soon after, when Fingal, according to cuſtom, was to appoint
   one of his chiefs to command the army, and each was ſtanding forth, and putting in his claim to
   this honour, Fillan is preſented in the following moſt pictureſque and natural attitude: “On his
   ſpear ſtood the Son of Clatho, in the wandering of his locks. Thrice he raiſed his eyes to
   Fingal; his voice thrice failed him as he ſpoke. Fillan could not boaſt of battles; at once he
   ſtrode away. Bent over a diſtant ſtream he ſtood; the tear hung in his eye. He ſtruck, at times,
   the thiſtle's head with his inverted ſpear.” No leſs natural and beautiful is the deſcription of
   Fingal's paternal emotion on this occaſion. “Nor is he unſeen of Fingal. Sidelong he beheld his
   ſon. He beheld him with burſting joy. He hid the big tear with his locks, and turned amidſt his
   crowded ſoul.” The command, for that day, being given to Gaul, Fillan ruſhes amidſt the thickeſt
   of the foe, ſaves Gaul's life, who is wounded by a random arrow, and diſtinguiſhes himſelf ſo in
   battle, that “the days of old return on Fingal's mind, as he beholds the renown of his ſon. As
   the ſun rejoices from the cloud, over the tree his beams have raiſed,

   heath, ſo joyful is the king over Fillan.” Sedate, however, and wiſe, he mixes the praiſe which
   he beſtows on him with ſome reprehenſion of his raſhneſs. “My ſon, I ſaw thy deeds, and my ſoul
   was glad. Thou art brave, ſon of Clatho, but headlong in the ſtrife. So did not Fingal advance,
   though he never feared a foe. Let thy people be a ridge behind thee; they are thy ſtrength in the
   field. Then ſhalt thou be long renowned, and behold the tombs of thy fathers.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">On </span>the next day, the, greateſt and the laſt of Fillan's life, the charge is
   committed to him of leading on the hoſt to battle. Fingal's ſpeech to his troops on this occaſion
   is full of noble ſentiment; and, where he recommends his ſon to their care, extremely touching.
   “A young beam is before you: few are his ſteps to war. They are few, but he is valiant; defend my
   dark-haired ſon. Bring him back with joy; hereafter he may ſtand alone. His form is like his
   fathers; his ſoul is a flame of their fire.” When the battle begins, the poet puts forth his
   ſtrength to deſcribe the exploits of the young hero; who, at laſt encountering and killing with

   near, Oſſian, if anywhere, excels himſelf. Foldath being ſlain, and a general rout begun, there
   was no reſource left to the enemy but in the great Cathmore himſelf, who in this extremity
   deſcends from the hill, where, according to the cuſtom of thoſe princes, he ſurveyed the battle.
   Obſerve how this critical event is wrought up by the poet. “Wide-ſpreading over echoing Lubar,
   the flight of Bolga is rolled along. Fillan hung forward on their ſteps, and ſtrewed the heath
   with dead. Fingal rejoiced over his ſon.—Blue-ſhielded Cathmor roſe.—Son of Alpin, bring the
   harp! Give Fillan's praiſe to the wind: raiſe high his praiſe in my hall, while yet he ſhines in
   war. Leave, blue-eyed Clatho! leave thy hall; behold that early beam of thine! The hoſt is
   withered in its courſe. No farther look—it is dark—light trembling from the harp, ſtrike,
   virgins! ſtrike the ſound.” The ſudden interruption and ſuſpenſe of the narration on Cathmor's
   riſing from his hill, the abrupt burſting into the praiſe of Fillan, and the paſſionate
   apoſtrophe to his mother Clatho, are admirable efforts of poetical art, in order to intereſt us
   in Fillan's danger; and the whole is heightened by the immediate following ſimile,

   is to be met with in any poet, and which, if it had been found in Homer, would have been the
   frequent ſubject of admiration to critics: “Fillan is like a ſpirit of heaven, that deſcends from
   the ſkirt of big blaſt. The troubled ocean feels his ſteps as he ſtrides from wave to wave. His
   path kindles behind him; iſlands ſhake their heads on the heaving ſeas.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> the poet's art is not yet exhauſted. The fall of this noble young,
   warrior, or, in Oſſian's ſtyle, the extinction of this beam of heaven, could not be rendered too
   intereſting and affecting. Our attention is naturally drawn towards Fingal. He beholds front his
   hill the riſing of Cathmor, and the danger of his ſon. But what ſhall he do? “Shall Fingal riſe
   to his aid, and take the ſword of Luno? What then ſhall become of thy fame, ſon of white-boſomed
   Clatho? Turn not thine eves from Fingal, daughter of Iniſtore! I ſhall not quench thy early beam.
   No cloud of mine ſhall riſe, my ſon, upon thy ſoul of fire.” Struggling between concern for the
   fame, and fear for the ſafety of his ſon, be withdraws from the ſight of the engagement, and
   deſpatches Oſſian in haſte to the field,

   injunction: “Father of Oſcar!” addreſſing him by a title which on this occaſion has the higheſt
   propriety: “Father of Oſcar! lift the ſpear, defend the young in arms. But conceal thy ſteps from
   Fillan's eyes. He muſt not know that I doubt his ſteel.” Oſſian arrived too late. But unwilling
   to deſcribe Fillan vanquiſhed, the poet ſuppreſſes all the circumſtances of the combat with
   Cathmor; and only ſhews us the dying hero. We ſee him animated to the end with the ſame martial
   and ardent ſpirit; breathing his laſt in bitter regret for-being ſo early cut off from the field
   of glory. “Oſſian, lay me in that hollow rock. Raiſe no ſtone above me, leſt one ſhould aſk about
   my fame. I am fallen in the firſt of my fields; fallen without renown. Let thy voice alone ſend
   joy to my flying ſoul. Why ſhould the bard know where dwells the early-fallen Fillan?” He who,
   after tracing the circumſtances of this ſtory, ſhall deny that our bard is poſſeſſed of high
   ſentiment and high art, muſt be ſtrangely prejudiced indeed. Let him read the ſtory of Pallas in

I waive inſiſting on any

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> judgment and art diſcovered in conducting works of ſuch length as Fingal
   and Temora, diſtinguiſh them from the other poems in this collection. The ſmaller pieces,
   however, contain particular beauties, no leſs eminent. They are hiſtorical poems, generally of
   the elegiac kind; and plainly diſcover themſelves to be the work of the ſame author. One
   conſiſtent face of manners is everywhere preſented to us; one ſpirit of poetry reigns; the
   maſterly hand of Oſſian appears throughout; the ſame rapid and animated ſtyle; the ſame ſtrong
   colouring of imagination, and the ſame glowing ſenſibility of heart. Beſides the unity which
   belongs to the compoſitions of one man, there is moreover a certain unity of ſubject, which very
   happily connects all theſe poems. They form the poetical hiſtory of the age, of Fingal, The ſame
   race of heroes whom we had met with in the greater poems, Cuthullin, Oſcar, Connar, and Gaul,
   return again upon the ſtage; and Fingal himſelf is always the principal figure, preſented on

   laſt. The circumſtances of Oſſian's old age and blindneſs, his ſurviving all his friends, and his
   relating their great exploits to Malvina, the ſpouſe or miſtreſs of his beloved ſon Oſcar,
   furniſh the fineſt poetical ſituations that fancy could deviſe for that tender pathetic which
   reigns in Oſſian's poetry.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">On</span> each of theſe poems there might be room for ſeparate obſervations, with
   regard to he conduct and diſpoſitions of the incidents, as well as to the beauty of the
   deſcriptions and ſentiments. Carthon is a regular and highly finiſhed piece. The main ſtory is
   very properly introduced by Cleſſamore's relation of the adventure of his youth; and this
   introduction is finely heightened by Fingal's ſong of mourning over Moina; in which Oſſian, ever
   fond of doing honour to his father, has contrived to diſtinguiſh him for being an eminent poet,
   as well as warrior. Fingal's ſong upon this occaſion, when “his thouſand bards leaned forwards
   from their ſeats, to hear the voice of the king,” is inferior to no paſſage in the whole book;
   and with great judgement put in his mouth, as the ſeriouſneſs, no leſs than the ſublimity of the
   ſtrain, is peculiarly ſuited to the hero's character. In Darthula are

   can touch the heart of man, friendſhip, love, the affections of parents, ſons, and brothers, the
   diſtreſs of the aged, and the unavailing bravery of the young. The beautiful addreſs to the moon,
   with which the poem opens, and the tranſition from thence to the ſubject, moſt happily prepare
   the mind for that train of affecting events that is to follow. The ſtory is regular, dramatic,
   intereſting to the laſt. He who can read it without emotion may congratulate himſelf, if he
   pleaſes, upon being completely armed againſt ſympathetic ſorrow. As Fingal had no occaſion of
   appearing in the action of this poem, Oſſian makes a very artful tranſition from his narration,
   to what was paſſing in the halls of Selma. The ſound heard there on the ſtrings of his harp, the
   concern which Fingal ſhews on bearing it, and the invocation of the ghoſts of their fathers, to
   receive the heroes falling in a diſtant land, are introduced with great beauty of imagination to
   increaſe the ſolemnity, and to diverſify the ſcenery of the poem.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Carric-thura</span> is full of the moſt ſublime dignity; and has this advantage, of

   ſeems to have been the great delight of Oſſian and the bards of his age. Lathmon is peculiarly
   diſtinguiſhed by high generoſity of ſentiment. This is carried ſo far, particularly in the
   refuſal of Gaul, on one ſide, to take the advantage of a ſleeping foe; and of Lathmon, on the
   other, to overpower by numbers the two young warriors as to recall into one's mind the manners of
   chivalry; ſome reſemblance to which may perhaps be ſuggeſted by other incidents in this
   collection of poems. Chivalry, however, took riſe in an age and country too remote from thoſe of
   Oſſian, to admit the ſuſpicion that the one could have borrowed any thing from the other. So far
   as chivalry had any real exiſtence, the ſame military enthuſiaſm which gave birth to it in the
   feudal times, might, in the days of Oſſian, that is, in the infancy of a riſing ſtate, through
   the operation of the ſame cauſe, very naturally produce effects of the ſame kind on the minds and
   manners of men. So far as chivalry was an ideal ſyſtem, exiſting only in romance, it will not be
   thought ſurpriſing, when we reflect on the account before given of the Celtic bards, that this
   imaginary refinement of heroic manners ſhould be found among them, as much, at leaſt, as among

   gallantry and generoſity of thoſe fabulous knights, without their extravagance; and his love
   ſcenes have native tenderneſs, without any mixture of thoſe forced and unnatural conceits which
   abound in the old romances. The adventures related by our poet which reſemble the moſt thoſe of
   romance, concern women who follow their lovers to war diſguiſed in the armour of men; and theſe
   are ſo managed as to produce, in the diſcovery, ſeveral of the moſt intereſting ſituations; one

   would have been admired in any poet of the moſt refined age. The conduct of Cruma muſt ſtrike
   every reader as remarkably judicious and beautiful. We are to be prepared for the death of
   Malvina, which is related in the ſucceeding poem. She is therefore introduced in perſon; “ſhe has
   heard a voice in her dream; She feels the fluttering of her ſoul:” and in a moſt moving
   lamentation addreſſed to her beloved Oſcar, ſhe ſings her own death-ſong. Nothing could be
   calculated with more art to ſooth and comfort her than the ſtory which Oſſian relates. In the
   young and brave Fovargormo, another Oſcar is introduced: his praiſes are ſung; and the happineſs
   is ſet before her of thoſe who die in their youth “when their renown is around them; before the
   feeble behold them in the hall, and ſmile at their trembling hands.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> nowhere does Oſſian's genius appear to greater advantage, than in

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> whole train of ideas is admirably ſuited to the ſubject. Every thing is
   full of that inviſible world, into which the aged bard believes himſelf now ready to enter. The
   airy ball of Fingal preſents itſelf to his view; “he ſees the cloud that ſhall receive his ghoſt;
   he beholds the miſt that ſhall form his robe when he appears on his hill;” and all the natural
   objects around him ſeem to carry the preſages of death. “The thiſtle ſhakes its beard to the
   wind. The flower hangs its heavy head; it ſeems to any, I am covered with the drops of heaven;
   the time of my departure is near, and the blaſt that ſhall ſcatter my leaves.” Malvina's death is
   hinted to him in the moſt delicate manner by the ſon of Alpin. His lamentation over her, her
   apotheoſis, or aſcent to the habitation of heroes, and the introduction to the ſtory which
   follows from the mention which Oſſian ſuppoſes the father of Malvina to make of him in the ball
   of Fingal, are all in the higheſt ſpirit of poetry. “And doſt thou remember Oſſian, O Toſcar, ſon
   of Conloch? The battles of our youth were many; our ſwords went together to the field.” Nothing
   could be more proper than to end his ſongs with recording an exploit of the father of that

   his poems.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſcene of moſt of Oſſian's poems is laid in Scotland, or in the coaſt of
   Ireland, oppoſite to the territories of Fingal. When the ſcene is in Ireland, we perceive no
   change of manners from thoſe of Oſſian's native country. For as Ireland was undoubtedly peopled
   with Celtic tribes, the language, cuſtoms, and religion of both nations were the ſame. They had
   been ſeparated from one another by migration, only a few generations, as it ſhould ſeem, before
   our poet's age; and they ſtill maintained a cloſe and frequent intercourſe. But when the poet
   relates the expeditions of any of his heroes to the Scandinavian coaſt, or to the iſlands of
   Orkney, which were then part of the Scandinavian territory, as he does in Carric-thura, Sul-malla
   of Lumon, and Cathloda, the caſe is quite altered. Thoſe countries were inhabited by nations of
   the Teutonic deſcent, who, in their manners and religious rites, differed widely from the Celtæ;
   and it is curious and remarkable, to find this difference clearly pointed out in the poems of
   Oſſian. His deſcriptions bear the native marks of one who was preſent in the expeditions which he
   relates, and who deſcribes what he had ſeen with his own eyes. No ſooner are we carried to

   are in a foreign region. New objects begin to appear. We meet everywhere with the ſtones and
   circles of Loda, that is, Odin, the great Scandinavian deity. We meet with the divinations and
   enchantments for which it is well known thoſe northern nations were early famous. “There, mixed
   with the murmur of waters, roſe the voice of aged men, who called the forms of night to aid them
   in their war;” whilſt the Caledonian chiefs, who aſſiſted them, are deſcribed as ſtanding at a
   diſtance, heedleſs of their rites. That ferocity of manners which diſtinguiſhed thoſe nations,
   alſo becomes conſpicuous. In the combats of their chiefs there is a peculiar ſavageneſs; even
   their women are bloody and fierce. The ſpirit. and the very ideas of Regner Lodbrog, that
   northern ſcalder, whom I formerly quoted, occur to us again. “The hawks,” Oſſian makes one of the
   Scandinavian chiefs ſay, “ruſh from all their winds; they are wont to trace my courſe. We
   rejoiced three days above the dead, and called the hawks of heaven, They came from all their
   winds, to feaſt on the foes of Annir.”</p>

   diſcerns nothing new or peculiar in the object he means to deſcribe. His conceptions of it are
   vague and looſe; his expreſſions feeble; and of courſe the object is preſented to us
   indiſtinctly, and as through a cloud. But a true poet makes us imagine that we ſee it before our
   eyes; he catches the diſtinguiſhing features; he gives it the colours of life and reality; he
   places it in ſuch a light that a painter could copy after him. This happy talent is chiefly owing
   to a lively imagination, which firſt receives a ſtrong impreſſion of the object; and then, by a
   proper ſelection of capital pictureſque circumſtances employed in deſcribing it, tranſmits that
   impreſſion in its full force to the imaginations of others. That Oſſian poſſeſſes this
   deſcriptive power in a high degree, we have a clear proof, from the effect which his deſcriptions

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">It</span> has been objected to Oſſian, that his deſcriptions of military actions
   are imperfect, and much leſs diverſified by the circumſtances than thoſe of Homer. This is in
   ſome meaſure true. The amazing fertility of Homer's invention, is nowhere ſo much diſplayed as in
   the incidents of his battles, and in the little hiſtory pieces he gives of the perſons ſlain.
   Nor, indeed, with regard to the talent of deſcription, can too much be ſaid in praiſe of Homer.
   Every thing is alive in his writings. The colours with which he paints are thoſe of nature. But
   Oſſian's genius was of a different kind from Homer's. It led him to hurry towards grand objects,
   rather than to amuſe himſelf with particulars of leſs importance. He could dwell on the death of
   a favourite hero; but that of a private man ſeldom ſtopped his rapid courſe. Homer's genius was
   more comprehenſive than Oſſian's. It included a wider circle of objects; and could work up any
   incident into deſcription. Oſſian's was more limited; but the region within which it

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">We</span> muſt not imagine, however, that Oſſian's battles conſiſt only of general

   of the perſons ſlain ſo much diverſified, as ſhow that be could have embelliſhed his military
   ſcenes with an abundant variety of particulars, if his genius had led him to dwell upon them.
   “One man is ſtretched in the duſt of his native land; he fell, where often he had ſpread the
   feaſt, and often raiſed the voice of the harp.” The maid of Iniſtore is introduced in a moving
   apoſtrophe, as weeping for another; and a third, “as rolled in the duſt he lifted his faint eyes
   to the king,” is remembered and mourned by Fingal as the friend of Agandecca. The blood pouring
   from the wound of one who was ſlain by night, is heard “hiſſing on the half-extinguiſhed oak,”
   which had been kindled for giving light. Another climbing up a tree to eſcape from his foe, is

   our ſwords poured together. We drew them behind the wood, and tried the ſtrength of our arms on
   the empty air.`</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Oſſian</span> is always conciſe in his deſcriptions, which adds much to their
   beauty and force. For it is a great miſtake to imagine, that a crowd of particulars, or a very
   fall and extended ſtyle, is of advantage to deſcription. On the contrary, ſuch a diffuſe manner
   for the moſt part weakens it. Any one redundant circumſtance is a nuiſance. It encumbers and
   loads the fancy, and renders the main image indiſtinct. “Obſtat,” as Quintilian ſays with regard
   to ſtyle, “quicquid non adjuvat.” To be conciſe in deſcription, is one thing: and to be general,
   is another. No deſcription that reſts in generals can poſſibly be good; it can convey no lively
   idea; for it is of particulars only that we have a diſtinct conception. But, at the ſame time, no
   ſtrong imagination dwells long upon any one particular; or heaps together a maſs of trivial ones.

   one glance than a feeble imagination is able to do, by turning its object round and round into a
   variety of lights. Tacitus is of all proſe writers the moſt conciſe. He has even a degree of
   abruptneſs reſembling our author: yet no writer is more eminent for lively deſcription. When
   Fingal, after having conquered the haughty Swaran, propoſes to diſmiſs him with honour: “Raiſe
   to-morrow thy white ſails to the wind, thou brother of Agandecca!” he conveys, by thus addreſſing
   his enemy, a ſtronger impreſſion of the emotions then paſſing within his mind, than if whole
   paragraphs had been ſpent in deſcribing the conflict between reſentment againſt Swaran and the
   tender remembrance of his ancient love. No amplification is needed to give us the moſt full idea
   of a hardy veteran, after the few following words: “His ſhield is marked with the ſtrokes of
   battle; his red eye deſpiſes danger.” When Oſcar left alone, was ſurrounded by foes, “he ſtood,”
   it is ſaid, “growing in his place, like the flood of the narrow vale;” a happy repreſentation of
   one, who, by daring intrepidity in the midſt of danger, ſeems to increaſe in his appearance, and
   becomes more formidable every moment, like the ſudden riſing of the torrent hemmed in

And a whole crowd of ideas,
   concerning the circumſtances of domeſtic ſorrow, occaſioned by a young warrior's firſt going
   forth to battle, is poured upon the mind by theſe words: “Calmar leaned on his father's ſpear;
   that ſpear which he brought from Lara's hall, when the ſoul of his mother was ſad.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> conciſeneſs of Oſſian's deſcriptions is the more proper, on account of
   his ſubjects. Deſcriptions of gay and ſmiling ſcenes may, without any diſadvantage, be amplified
   and prolonged. Force is not the predominant quality expected in theſe. The deſcription may be
   weakened by being diffuſe, yet, notwithſtanding, may be beautiful ſtill; whereas, with reſpect to
   grand, ſolemn, and pathetic ſubjects, which are Oſſian's chief field, the caſe is very different.
   In theſe, energy is above all things required. The imagination muſt be ſeized at once, or not at
   all; and is far more deeply impreſſed by one ſtrong and ardent image, than by the anxious
   minuteneſs of labored illuſtration.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> Oſſian's genius, though chiefly turned towards the ſublime and pathetic,
   was not confined to it. In ſubjects alſo of grace and delicacy, he diſcovers the hand of a
   maſter. Take for an example the following elegant deſcription of Agandecca, wherein the

   “The daughter of the ſnow overheard, and left the hall of her ſecret ſigh. She came in all her
   beauty; like the moon from the cloud of the eaſt. Lovelineſs was around her as light. Her ſteps
   were like the muſic of ſongs. She ſaw the youth and loved him. He was the ſtolen ſigh of her
   ſoul. Her blue eyes rolled on him in ſecret; and ſhe bleſt the chief of Morven.” Several other
   inſtances might be produced of the feelings of love and friendſhip, painted by our author with a
   moſt natural and happy delicacy.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſimplicity of Oſſian's manner adds great beauty to his deſcriptions, and
   indeed to his whole poetry. We meet with no affected ornaments; no forced refinement; no marks
   either in ſtyle or thought of a ſtudied endeavor to ſhine or ſparkle. Oſſian appears everywhere
   to be prompted by his feelings; and to ſpeak from the abundance of his heart. I remember no more
   than one inſtance of what may be called a quaint thought in this whole collection of his works.
   It is in the firſt book of Fingal, where, from the tombs of two lovers, two lonely yews are
   mentioned to have ſprung, “whoſe branches wiſhed to meet on high.” This ſympathy of the trees
   with the lovers, may be reckoned to

   ſomewhat curious to find this ſingle inſtance of that ſort of wit in our Celtic poetry.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> “joy of grief” is one of Oſſian's remarkable expreſſions, ſeveral times
   repeated. If any one ſhall think that it needs to be juſtified by a precedent, he may find it
   twice uſed by Homer: in the Iliad, when Achilles is viſited by the ghoſt of Patroclus; and in the
   Odyſſey, when Ulyſſes meets his mother in the ſhades. On both theſe occaſions, the heroes, melted
   with tenderneſs, lament their not having it in their power to throw their arms round the ghoſt,
   “that we might,” ſay they, “in mutual embrace, enjoy the delight of grief. “ <span class="quote">

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> in truth, the expreſſion ſtands in need of no defence from authority;
   for it is a natural and juſt expreſſion; and conveys a clear idea of that gratification which a
   virtuous heart often feels in the indulgence of a tender melancholy. Oſſian makes a very proper
   diſtinction between this gratification and the deſtructive effect of overpowering grief. “There
   is a joy in grief when peace dwells in the breaſts of the ſad. But ſorrow waſtes the mournful, O
   daughter of Toſcar, and their days are few.” To “give the joy of grief,” generally ſignifies to

   and finely characterizes the taſte of Oſſian's age and country. In thoſe days, when the ſongs of
   bards were the great delight of heroes, the tragic muſe was hold in chief honour: gallant actions
   and virtuous ſufferings, were the choſen theme; preferably to that light and trifling ſtrain, of
   poetry and muſic, which promotes light and trifling manners, and ſerves to emaſculate the mind.
   “Strike the harp in my hall,” ſaid the great Fingal, in the midſt of youth and victory; “ſtrike
   the harp in my hall, and let Fingal hear the ſong. Pleaſant is the joy of grief! It is like the
   ſhower O of ſpring, when it ſoftens the branch of the oak; and the young leaf lifts its green
   head. Sing on, O bards! To-morrow we lift the ſail.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Perſonal</span> epithets have been much uſed by all the poets of the moſt ancient
   ages; and when well choſen, not general and unmeaning, they contribute not a little to render the
   ſtyle deſcriptive and animated. Beſides epithets founded on bodily diſtinctions, akin to many of
   Homer's, we find in Oſſian ſeveral which are remarkably beautiful and poetical. Such as Oſcar of
   the future fights, Fingal of the mildeſt look, Carril of other times, the mildly bluſhing
   Evir-allin: Bragela, the lonely ſun-beam of Dunſcaich; a Culdee, the ſon of the ſecret cell.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> of all the ornaments employed in deſcriptive poetry, compariſons or
   ſimiles are the moſt ſplendid. Theſe chiefly form what is called the imagery of a poem; and as
   they abound go much in the works of Oſſian, and are commonly among the favourite paſſages of all
   poets, it may be expected that I ſhould be ſomewhat particular in my remarks upon them.</p>
  <p class="noindent">A poetical<span class="sc"/> ſimile always ſuppoſes two objects brought together, between which
   there is ſome near relation or connection in the fancy. What that relation ought to be, cannot be
   preciſely defined. For various, almoſt numberleſs, are the analogies formed among objects, by a
   ſprightly imagination. The relation of actual ſimilitude, or likeneſs of appearance, is far from
   being the only foundation of poetical compariſon. Sometimes a reſemblance in the effect produced
   by two objects, is made the connecting principle: ſometimes a reſemblance in one diſtinguiſhing
   property or circumſtance. Very often two objects are brought together in a ſimile, though they
   reſemble one another, ſtrictly ſpeaking, in nothing, only becauſe they raiſe in the mind a train
   of ſimilar, and what may be called concordant, ideas; ſo that the remembrance of the one, when
   recalled, ſerves to quicken and heighten the impreſſion made by the other. Thus, to give an

   looks back on the exploits of his youth, has certainly no direct reſemblance to the beauty of a
   fine evening; further than that both agree in producing a certain calm, placid joy. Yet Oſſian
   has founded upon this, one of the moſt beautiful compariſons that is to be met with in any poet.
   “Wilt thou not liſten, ſon of the rock, to the ſong of Oſſian? My ſoul is full of other times;
   the joy of my youth returns. Thus the ſun appears in the weſt, after the ſteps of his brightneſs
   have moved behind a ſtorm. The green hills lift their dewy heads. The blue ſtreams rejoice in the
   vale. The aged hero comes forth on his ſtaff; and his gray hair glitters in the beam.” Never was
   there a finer group of objects. It raiſes a ſtrong conception of the old man's joy and elation of
   heart, by diſplaying a ſcene which produces in every ſpectator a correſponding train of pleaſing
   emotions; the declining ſun looking forth in his brightneſs after a ſtorm; the cheerful face of
   all nature; and the ſtill life finely animated by the circumſtance of the aged hero, with his
   ſtaff and his gray locks: a circumſtance both extremely pictureſque, in itſelf, and peculiarly
   ſuited to the main object of the compariſon. Such analogies and aſſociations of ideas as theſe,
   are highly pleaſing to the fancy. They give

   which he ſees around him, and which have often ſtruck his fancy. For this reaſon, In order to
   judge of the propriety of poetical imagery, we ought to be in ſome meaſure acquainted with the
   natural hiſtory of the country where the ſcene of the poem is laid. The introduction of foreign
   images betrays a poet, copying not from nature, but from other writers. Hence ſo many lions, and
   tigers, and eagles, and ſerpents, which we meet, with in the ſimiles of modern poets; as if theſe
   animals had acquired ſome right to a place in poetical compariſons for ever, becauſe employed by
   ancient authors. They employed them with propriety, as objects generally known in their, country,
   but they are abſurdly uſed for illuſtration by us, who know them only at ſecond hand, or by
   deſcription. To moſt readers of modern poetry, it were more to the purpoſe to deſcribe lions or
   tigers by ſimiles taken from men, than to compare men to lions. Oſſian is very correct in this
   particular. His imagery is, without exception, copied from that face of nature which be ſaw
   before his eyes; and by conſequence may be expected to be lively. We meet with no Grecian or
   Italian ſcenery; but with the miſts and clouds, and ſtorms, of a northern mountainous region.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">No</span> poet abounds more in ſimiles than Oſſian. There are in this collection as
   many, at leaſt, as in the whole Iliad and Odyſſey of Homer. I am indeed inclined to think, that
   the works of both poets are too much crowded with them. Similes are ſparkling ornaments; and,
   like all things that ſparkle, are apt to dazzle and tire us by their luſtre. But if Oſſian's
   ſimiles be too frequent, they have this advantage, of being commonly ſhorter than Homer's; they
   interrupt his narration leſs; he juſt glances aſide to ſome reſembling, object, and inſtantly
   returns to his former track. Homer's ſimiles include a wider range of objects; but, in return,
   Oſſian's, are, without exception, taken from objects of dignity, which cannot be ſaid for all
   thoſe which Homer employs. The ſun, the moon, and the ſtars, clouds and meteors, lightning and
   thunder, ſeas and whales, rivers, torrents, winds, ice, rain, ſnow, dews, miſt, fire and ſmoke,
   trees and foreſts, heath and graſs and flowers, rocks and mountains, muſic and ſongs, light and
   darkneſs, ſpirits and ghoſts; theſe form the circle within which Oſſian's compariſons generally
   run. Some, not many, are taken from birds and beaſts: as eagles, ſea-fowl, the horſe, the deer,
   and the mountain bee; and a very few from ſuch operations of art as were then known.

   more alluſions to the animal world; to lions, bulls, goats, herds of cattle, ſerpents, inſects;
   and to various occupations of rural and paſtoral life. Oſſian's defect in this article, is
   plainly owing to the deſert, uncultivated ſtate of his country, which ſuggeſted to him few images
   beyond natural inanimate objects, in their rudeſt form. The birds and animals of the country were
   probably not numerous; and his acquaintance with them was ſlender, as they were little ſubjected
   to the uſes of man.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> great objection made to Oſſian's imagery, is its uniformity, and the too
   frequent repetition of the ſame compariſon. In a work ſo thick-ſown with ſimiles one could not
   but expect to find images of the ſame kind ſometimes ſuggeſted to the poet by reſembling objects;
   eſpecially to a poet like Oſſian, who wrote from the immediate impulſe of poetical enthuſiaſm,
   and without much preparation of ſtudy or labor. Fertile as Homer's imagination is acknowledged to
   be, who does not know how often his lions, and bulls, and flocks of ſheep, recur with little or
   no variation; nay, ſometimes, in the very ſame words? The objection made to Oſſian is, however,
   founded, in a great meaſure, upon a miſtake. It has been ſuppoſed

   moon, the cloud, or the thunder, returns in a ſimile, it is the ſame ſimile, and the ſame moon,
   or cloud, or thunder, which they had met with a few pages before. Whereas very often the ſimiles
   are widely different. The object, from whence they are taken, is indeed in ſubſtance the ſame;
   but the image is new; for the appearance of the object is changed; it is preſented to the fancy
   in another attitude: and clothed with new circumſtances, to make it ſuit the different
   illuſtration for which it is employed. In this lies Oſſian's great art; in ſo happily varying the
   form of the few natural appearances with which he was acquainted, as to make them correſpond to a
   great many different objects.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Let</span> us take for one inſtance the moon, which is very frequently introduced
   in his compariſons; as in northern climates, where the nights are long, the moon is a greater
   object of attention than in the climate of Homer; and let us view how much our poet has
   diverſified its appearance. The ſhield of it warrior is like “the darkened moon when it moves a
   dun circle through the heavens.” The face of a ghoſt, wan and ale, is like “the beam of the
   ſetting moon.” And a different appearance of a ghoſt, thin and indiſtinct, is like “the

   when the ſky pours down its flaky ſnow, and the world is ſilent and dark;” or, in a different
   form ſtill, is like “the watery beam of the moon, when it ruſhes from between two clouds, and the
   midnight ſhower is on the field.” A very oppoſite uſe is made of the moon in the deſcription of
   Agandecca: “She came in all her beauty, like the moon from the cloud of the eaſt.” Hope ſucceeded
   by diſappointment, is “joy riſing on her face and ſorrow returning again, like a thin cloud on
   the moon.” But when Swaran, after his defeat, is cheered by Fingal's generoſity, “his face
   brightened like the full moon of heaven, when the clouds vaniſh away, and leave her calm and
   broad in the midſt of the ſky.” Venvela is “bright as the moon when it trembles o'er the weſtern
   wave;” but the ſoul of the guilty Uthal is “dark as the troubled face of the moon, when it
   foretells the ſtorm.” And by a very fanciful and uncommon alluſion, it is ſaid of Cormac, who was
   to die in his early years, “Nor long ſhalt thou lift the ſpear, mildly-ſhining beam of youth!
   Death ſtands dim behind thee, like the darkened half of the moon behind its growing light.”</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Another</span> inſtance of the ſame nature may be taken from miſt, which, as being
   a very familiar appearance in the country of Oſſian, he applies to a variety of purpoſes, and
   purſues through a great many forms. Sometimes, which one would hardly expect, he employs it to
   heighten the appearance of a beautiful object. The hair of Morna is “like the miſt of Cromla,
   when it curls on the rock, and ſhines to the beam of the weſt.” “The ſong comes with its muſic to
   melt and pleaſe the ear. It is like ſoft miſt, that riſing from the lake pours on the ſilent
   vale. The green flowers are filled with dew. The ſun returns in its ſtrength, and, the miſt is
   gone<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333567200"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>.” But, for the moſt part, miſt is employed as a
   ſimilitude of ſome diſagreeable or terrible object. “The ſoul of Nathos was ſad, like the ſun in

   dim.”—“The darkneſs of old age comes like the miſt of the deſert.” The face of a ghoſt is “pale
   as the miſt of Cromla.”—“The gloom of battle is rolled along as miſt that is poured on the
   valley, when ſtorms invade the ſilent ſunſhine of heaven.” Fame, ſuddenly departing, is likened
   to “miſt that flies away before the ruſtling wind of the vale.” A ghoſt, ſlowly vaniſhing, to
   “miſt that melts by degrees on the ſunny hill.” Cairbar, after his treacherous aſſaſſination of
   Oſcar, is compared to a peſtilential fog. “I love a foe like Cathmor,” ſays Fingal, “his ſoul is
   great; his arm is ſtrong; his battles are full of fame. But the little ſoul is like a vapor that
   hovers round the marſhy lake. It never riſes on the green hill, leſt the winds meet it there. Its
   dwelling is in the cave; and it ſends forth the dart of death.” This is a ſimile highly finiſhed.
   But there is another which is ſtill more ſtriking, founded alſo on miſt, in the fourth book of
   Temora. Two factious chiefs are contending: Cathmor, the king, interpoſes, rebukes, and ſilences
   them. The poet intends to give us the higheſt idea of Cathmor's ſuperiority; and moſt effectually
   accompliſhes his intention by the following happy image. “They ſunk

   columns of morning miſt, when the ſun riſes between them on his glittering rocks. Dark is their
   rolling on either ſide; each towards its reedy pool.” Theſe inſtances may ſufficiently ſhow with
   what richneſs of imagination Oſſian's compariſons abound, and, at the ſame time, with what
   propriety of judgment they are employed. If his field was narrow, it muſt be admitted to have
   been as well cultivated as its extent would allow.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">As</span> it is uſual to judge of poets from a compariſon of their ſimiles more
   than of other paſſages, it will, perhaps, be agreeable to the reader, to ſee how Homer and Oſſian
   have conducted ſome images of the ſame kind. This might be ſhown in many inſtances. For as the
   great objects of nature are common to the poets of all nations, and make the general ſtorehouſe
   of all imagery, the groundwork of their compariſons muſt, of courſe, be Frequently the ſame. I
   ſhall ſelect only a few of the moſt conſiderable from both poets. Mr. Pope's tranſlation of Homer
   can be of no uſe to us here. The parallel is altogether unfair between proſe and the impoſing
   harmony of flowing numbers. It is only by viewing Homer in the ſimplicity of a

   compariſon between the two bards.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſhock of two encountering armies, the noiſe and the tumult of battle,
   afford one of the moſt grand and awful ſubjects of deſcription; on which all epic poets have
   exerted their ſtrength. Let us firſt hear Homer. The following deſcription is a favourite one,
   for we find it twice repeated in the ſame words<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333554592"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>. “When now the conflicting hoſts joined in the
   field of battle, then were mutually oppoſed ſhields, and ſwords, and the ſtrength of armed men.
   The boſſy bucklers were daſhed againſt each other. The univerſal tumult roſe. There were mingled
   the triumphant ſhouts and the dying groans of the victors and the vanquiſhed. The earth ſtreamed
   with blood. As when winter torrents, ruſhing from the mountains, pour into a narrow valley their
   violent waters. They iſſue from a thouſand ſprings, and mix in the hollowed channel. The diſtant
   ſhepherd hears on the mountain their roar from afar. Such was the terror and the ſhout of the
   engaging armies.” In another paſſage, the poet, much in the manner of Oſſian, heaps ſimile on
   ſimile, to expreſs the vaſtneſs of

   labor. “With a mighty ſhout the hoſts engage. Not ſo loud roars the wave of ocean, when driven
   againſt the ſhore by the whole force of the boiſterous north; not ſo loud in the woods of the
   mountain, the noiſe of the flame, when riſing in its fury to conſume the foreſt; not ſo loud the
   wind among the lofty oaks, when the wrath of the worm rages; as was the clamor of the Greeks and

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">To</span> theſe deſcriptions and ſimiles, we may oppoſe the following from Oſſian,
   and leave the reader to judge between them. He will find images of the ſame kind employed;
   commonly leſs extended; but thrown forth with a glowing rapidity which characterizes our poet.
   “As autumn's dark ſtorms pour from two echoing hills, towards each other approached the heroes.
   As two dark ſtreams from high rocks meet and mix, and roar on the plains; loud, rough, and dark
   in battle, meet Lochlin and Iniſfail. Chief mixed his ſtrokes with chief, and man with man. Steel

   noiſe of the ocean, when roll the waves on high; as the laſt peal of the thunder of heaven; ſuch
   is the noiſe of battle.” “As roll a thouſand waves to the rock, ſo Swaran's beſt came on; as
   meets a rock a thouſand waves, ſo Iniſfail met Swaran. Death raiſes all his voices around, and
   mixes with the ſound of ſhields.—The field echoes from wing to wing, as a hundred hammers that
   riſe by turns on the red ſon of the furnace.”—“As a hundred winds on Morven; as the ſtreams of a
   hundred hills; as clouds fly ſucceſſive over heaven or as the dark ocean aſſaults the ſhore of
   the deſert ſo roaring, ſo vaſt, ſo terrible, the armies mixed on Lena's echoing heath.” In
   ſeveral of theſe images there is a remarkable ſimilarity to Homer's: but what follows is ſuperior
   to any compariſon that Homer uſes on this ſubject. “The groan of the people ſpread over the
   hills; it was like the thunder of night, when the cloud burſts on Cona, and a thouſand ghoſts
   ſhriek at once on the hollow wind.” Never was an image of, more awful ſublimity employed to

   “beholds from the rock a cloud borne along the ſea by the weſtern wind; black as pitch it appears
   from afar ſailing over the ocean, and carrying the dreadful ſtorm. He ſhrinks at the ſight, and
   drives his flock into the cave: ſuch, under the Ajaces, moved on the dark, the thickened phalanx
   to the war.”<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333541376"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a> —“They came,” ſays Oſſian, “over the deſert like ſtormy clouds,
   when the winds roll them over the heath; their edges are tinged with lightning; and the echoing
   groves foreſee the ſtorm.” The edges of the clouds tinged with lightning, is a ſublime idea: but
   the ſhepherd and his flock render Homer's ſimile more pictureſque. This is frequently the
   difference between the two poets. Oſſian gives no more than the main image, ſtrong and full:
   Homer adds circumſtances and appendages, which amuſe the fancy by enlivening the ſcenery.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Homer</span> compares the regular appearance of an army, to “clouds that are

   ſleeps<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333538352"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>.” Oſſian, with full as much propriety, compares the appearance of a

   its womb, and ſcatters the curling gloom on every ſide.” Oſſian's clouds aſſume a great many
   forms, and, as we might expect from his climate, are a fertile ſource of imagery to him. “The
   warriors followed their chiefs like the gathering of the rainy clouds behind the red meteors of
   heaven.” An army retreating without coming to action, is likened to “clouds, that having long
   threatened rain, retire ſlowly behind the hills.” The picture of Oithona, after ſhe had
   determined to die, is lively and delicate. “Her ſoul was reſolved, and the tear was dried from
   her wildly-looking eye. A troubled joy roſe on her mind, like the red path of the lightning on a
   ſtormy cloud.” The image alſo of the gloomy Cairbar, meditating, in ſilence, the aſſaſſination of
   Oſcar, until the moment came when his deſigns were ripe for execution, is extremely noble and
   complete in all its parts. “Cairbar heard their words in ſilence, like the cloud of a ſhower; it
   ſtands dark on Cromla till the lightning burſts its ſide. The valley gleams with red light; the
   ſpirits of the ſtorm rejoice. So ſtood the ſilent king of Temora; at length his words are
   heard.”</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Homer's</span> compariſon of Achilles to the Dog-Star, is very ſublime. “Priam
   beheld him ruſhing along the plain, ſhining in his armour, like the ſtar of autumn bright are its
   beams, diſtinguiſhed amidſt the multitude of ſtars in the dark hour of night. It riſes in its
   ſplendor; but its ſplendor is fatal; betokening to miſerable men the deſtroying heat<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333530880"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>.” The firſt appearance of Fingal is, in like manner, compared by
   Oſſian to a ſtar or meteor. “Fingal, tall in his ſhip, ſtretched his bright lance before him.
   Terrible was the gleam of his ſteel; it was like the green meteor of death, ſetting in the heath
   of Malmor, when the traveller is alone, and the broad moon is darkened in heaven.” The hero's
   appearance in Homer is more magnificent; in Oſſian, more terrible.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">A tree</span> cut down, or overthrown by a ſtorm, is a ſimilitude frequent among
   poets for deſcribing the fall of a warrior in battle. Homer employs it often. But the moſt
   beautiful, by far, of his compariſons, founded on this object, indeed one of the moſt beautiful
   in the whole Iliad, is that on the death of Euphorbus. “As the young and verdant olive, which a
   man hath reared with care in a lonely field, where

   fair and flouriſhing; it is fanned by the breath of all the winds, and loaded with white
   bloſſoms; when the ſudden blaſt of a whirlwind deſcending, roots it out from its bed, and
   ſtretches it on the duſt <a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333526048"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>.” To this, elegant as it is, we may oppoſe the following ſimile of
   Oſſian's, relating to the death of the three ſons of Uſnoth. “They fell, like three young oaks
   which ſtood alone on the hill. The traveller ſaw the lovely trees, and wondered how they grew ſo
   lonely. The blaſt of the deſert came by night, and laid their green heads low. Next day he
   returned; but they were withered, and the heath was bare.” Malvina's alluſion to the ſame object,
   in her lamentation over Oſcar, is ſo exquiſitely tender, that I cannot forbear giving it a place
   alſo. “I was a lovely tree in thy preſence, Oſcar! with all my branches round me. But thy death
   came, like a blaſt from the deſert, and laid my green head low. The ſpring returned with its
   ſhowers; but no leaf of mine aroſe.” Several of Oſſian's ſimiles, taken from trees, are
   remarkably beautiful, and diverſified with well-choſen circumſtances ſuch as that upon the death
   of Ryno and Orla: They have fallen

   acroſs a ſtream, and withers in the wind of the mountains.” Or that which Oſſian applies to
   himſelf: “I, like an ancient oak in Morven, moulder alone in my place; the blaſt hath lopped my
   branches away; and I tremble at the winds of the north.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">As</span> Homer exalts his heroes by comparing them to gods, Oſſian makes the ſame
   uſe of compariſons taken from ſpirits and ghoſts. “Swaran roared in battle, like the ſhrill
   ſpirit of a ſtorm, that ſits dim on the clouds of Gormal, and enjoys the death of the mariner.”
   His people gathered round Erragon, “like ſtorms around the ghoſt of night, when he calls them
   from the top of Morven, and prepares to pour them on the land of the ſtranger.”—“They fell before
   my ſon like groves in the deſert, when an angry ghoſt ruſhes through night, and takes their green
   heads in his hand.” In ſuch images, Oſſian appears in his ſtrength; for very ſeldom have
   ſupernatural beings been painted with ſo much ſublimity, and ſuch force of imagination, as by
   this poet. Even Homer, great as he is, muſt yield to him in ſimiles formed upon theſe. Take, for
   inſtance, the following, which is the moſt remarkable of this kind in the Iliad.

   Mars, the deſtroyer of men, when lie ruſhes to war. Terror, his beloved ſon, ſtrong and fierce,
   attends him; who fills with diſmay the moſt valiant hero. They come from Thrace armed againſt the
   Ephyrians and Phlegyans; nor do they regard the prayers of either, but diſpoſe of ſucceſs at
   their will<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333517024"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>.” The idea here is undoubtedly noble, but obſerve what a figure
   Oſſian ſets before the aſtoniſhed imagination, and with what ſublimely terrible circumſtances he
   has heightened it. “He ruſhed, in the ſound of his arms, like the dreadful ſpirit of Loda, when
   he comes in the roar of a thouſand ſtorms, and ſcatters battles from his eyes. He ſits on a cloud
   over Lochlin's ſeas. His mighty hand is on his ſword. The wind lifts his flaming locks. So
   terrible was Cuthullin in the day of his fame.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Homer's</span> compariſons relate chiefly to martial ſubjects, to the appearances
   and motions of armies, the engagement and death of heroes, and the various incidents of war. In
   Oſſian, we find a greater variety of other ſubjects, illuſtrated by ſimiles, particularly the
   ſongs of bards, the beauty of women, the different circumſtances of

   give occaſion to much beautiful imagery. What, for inſtance, can be more delicate and moving,
   than the following ſimile of Oithona's, in her lamentation over the diſhonour ſhe had ſuffered
   “Chief of Strumon.” replied the ſighing maid, why didſt thou come over the dark blue wave to
   Nuath's mournful daughter? Why did not I paſs away in ſecret, like the flower of the rock, that
   lifts its fair head unſeen, and ſtrews its withered leaves on the blaſt?” The muſic of bards, a
   favourite object with Oſſian, is illuſtrated by a variety of the moſt beautiful appearances that
   are to be found in nature. It is compared to the calm ſhower of ſpring; to the dews of the
   morning on the hill of roes; to the face of the blue and ſtill lake. Two ſimiles on this ſubject
   I ſhall quote, becauſe they would do honour to any of the moſt celebrated claſſics. The one is:
   “Sit thou on the heath, O bard! and let us hear thy voice; it is pleaſant as the gale of the
   ſpring that ſighs on the hunter's ear, when he awakens from dreams of joy, and has heard the
   muſic of the ſpirits of the hill.” The other contains a ſhort but exquiſitely tender image,
   accompanied with the fineſt poetical painting. “The muſic of Carril was like the memory of joys
   that are paſt,

The
   ghoſts of departed bards heard it from Slimora's ſide. Soft ſounds ſpread along the wood; and the
   ſilent valleys of night rejoice.” What a figure would ſuch imagery and ſuch ſcenery have made,
   had they been preſented to us adorned with the ſweetneſs and harmony of the Virgilian
   numbers!</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">I have</span> choſen all along to compare Oſſian with Homer, rather than Virgil,
   for an obvious reaſon. There is a much nearer correſpondence between the times and manners of the
   two former poets. Both wrote in an early period of ſociety; both are originals; both are
   diſtinguiſhed by ſimplicity, ſublimity, and fire. The correct elegances of Virgil, his artful
   imitation of Homer, the Roman ſtatelineſs which he everywhere maintains, admit no parallel with
   the abrupt boldneſs and enthuſiaſtic warmth of the Celtic bard. In one article, indeed, there is
   a reſemblance. Virgil is more tender than Homer, and thereby agrees more with Oſſian; with this
   difference, that the feelings of the one are more gentle and poliſhed—thoſe of the other more
   ſtrong: the tenderneſs of Virgil ſoftenſ—that of Oſſian diſſolves and overcomes the heart.</p>

They abound
   much in this figure, and they uſe it with the utmoſt propriety<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333504224"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>. The imagery of Scripture exhibits a ſoil
   and climate altogether different from thoſe of Oſſian: a warmer country, a more ſmiling face of
   nature, the arts of agriculture and of rural life much farther advanced. The wine-preſs and the
   threſhing-floor are often preſented to us; the cedar and the palm-tree, the fragrance of perfumes
   the voice of the turtle, and the beds of lilies. The ſimiles are, like Oſſian's, generally ſhort,
   touching on one point of reſemblance, rather than ſpread out into little epiſodes. In the
   following example may be perceived what inexpreſſible grandeur poetry receives from the
   intervention of the Deity. “The nations ſhall ruſh like the ruſhing of many waters; but God ſhall
   rebuke them, and they ſhall fly far off, and ſhall be chaſed as the chaff of the “mountains

   the light of beauty; but her heart was the houſe of pride.” This mode of expreſſion, which
   ſuppreſſes the mark of compariſon, and ſubſtitutes a figured deſcription in room of the object
   deſcribed, is a great enlivener of ſtyle. It denotes that glow and rapidity of fancy, which,
   without pauſing to form a regular ſimile, paints the object at one ſtroke. “Thou art to me the
   beam of the caſt, riſing in a land unknown.”—“In peace, thou art the gale of ſpring; In war, the
   mountain ſtorm.”—“Pleaſant be thy reſt, O lovely beam! ſoon haſt thou ſet on our hills! The ſteps
   of thy departure were ſtately, like the moon on the blue trembling wave. But thou haſt left us in
   darkneſs, firſt of the maids of Lutha!—Soon haſt thou ſet, Malvina! but thou riſeſt, like the
   beam of the eaſt, among the ſpirits of thy friends, where they ſit in their ſtormy halls, the
   chambers of the thunder.” This is correct, and finely ſupported. But in the following inſtance,
   the metaphor, though very beautiful at the beginning, becomes imperfect before it cloſes, by
   being improperly mixed with the literal ſenſe. “Trathal went forth with the ſtream of his people:
   but they met a rock; Fingal ſtood unmoved; broken, they rolled back from his

Nor did they roll in ſafety; the Spear

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> hyperbole is a figure which we might expect to find often employed by
   Oſſian; as the undiſciplined imagination of early ages generally prompts exaggeration, and
   carries its objects to exceſs; whereas longer experience, and farther progreſs in the arts of
   life, chaſten men's ideas and expreſſions. Yet Oſſian's hyperboles appear not, to me, either ſo
   frequent or ſo harſh as might at firſt have been looked for; an advantage owing, no doubt, to the
   more cultivated ſtate in which, as was before ſhown, poetry ſubſiſted among the ancient Celtæ,
   than among moſt other barbarous nations. One of the moſt exaggerated deſcriptions in the whole
   work, is what meets us at the beginning of Fingal, where the ſcout makes his report to Cuthullin
   of the landing of the foe. But this is ſo far from deſerving cenſure, that it merits praiſe, as
   being on that occaſion natural and proper. The ſcout arrives, trembling and full of fears; and it
   is well known that no paſſion diſpoſes men to hyperbolize more than terror. It both annihilates
   themſelves in their own apprehenſion, and magnifies every object which they view through the
   medium of a troubled imagination. Hence all thoſe indiſtinct images of formidable

   it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we ſaw in it are

   even of mythological or legendary belief, with human actors, ſeldom produces a good effect. The

   The beauties of each are too great and too obvious to need any particular comment. In one paſſage
   only of the addreſs to the moon, there appears ſome obſcurity. “Whither doſt thou retire from thy

   in the ſhadow of grief? Have thy ſiſters fallen from heaven? Are they who rejoiced with thee, at
   night, no more? Yes, they have fallen, fair light! and thou doſt often retire to mourn.” We may
   be at a loſs to comprehend, at firſt view, the ground of thoſe ſpeculations of Oſſian concerning

   the preſent ſituation of his mind.

   paſſion, tinctures with its own diſpoſition every object which it beholds. The old bard, with his
   heart bleeding for the loſs of all his friends, is meditating on the different phaſes of the
   moon. Her waning and darkneſs preſent to his melancholy imagination the image of ſorrow; and
   preſently the idea ariſes, and is indulged, that like himſelf, ſhe retires to mourn over the loſs
   of other moons, or of ſtars, whom he calls her ſiſters, and fancies to have once rejoiced with

   ſuggeſted nothing ſo naturally to Oſſian as the death of beloved friends. An inſtance preciſely
   ſimilar, of this influence of paſſion, may be ſeen in a paſſage, which has always been admired,
   of Shakſpeare's King Lear. The old man, on the point of diſtraction through the inhumanity of his

   and imagery, it only remains to make ſome obſervations on his ſentiments. No ſentiments can be
   beautiful without being proper; that is, ſuited to the character and ſituation of thoſe who utter
   them. In this reſpect Oſſian is as correct as moſt writers. His characters, as above deſcribed,

   is the higheſt effect either of eloquence or poetry; and, to produce this effect, requires a
   genius glowing with the ſtrongeſt and warmeſt conception of ſome object, awful, great, or
   magnificent. That this character of genius belongs to Oſſian, may, I think, ſufficiently appear
   from many of the paſſages I have already had occaſion to quote. To produce more inſtances were
   ſuperfluous. If the engagement of Fingal with the ſpirit of Loda, in Carric-thura; if the

   ſentiment is preſented to it in its native form. But no ſooner does the poet attempt to ſpread
   out this ſentiment, or deſcription, and to deck it round and round with glittering ornaments,
   than the mind begins to fall from its high elevation; the tranſport is over; the beautiful may
   remain, but the ſublime is gone. Hence the conciſe and ſimple ſtyle of Oſſian gives great

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Sublimity</span>, as belonging to ſentiment, coincides, in a great meaſure, with
   magnanimity, heroiſm, and generoſity of ſentiment. Whatever diſcovers human nature in its
   greateſt elevation; whatever beſpeaks a high effort of ſoul, or ſhews a mind ſuperior to
   pleaſures, to dangers, and to death, forms what may be called the moral of ſentimental ſublime.
   For this Oſſian is eminently diſtinguiſhed. No poet maintains a higher tone of virtuous and noble
   ſentiment throughout all his works. Particularly in all the ſentiments of Fingal there is a
   grandeur and loftineſs, proper to ſwell the mind with the higheſt ideas of human perfection.
   Wherever he appears, we behold the hero. The objects which he purſues are always truly great: to
   bend the proud; to protect the injured; to defend his friends; to overcome his enemies by
   generoſity more than by force. A portion of the ſame ſpirit actuates all the other heroes. Valor
   reigns; but it is a generous valor, void of cruelty, animated by honour, not by hatred. We behold
   no debaſing paſſions

   avarice or of inſult; but a perpetual contention for fame; a deſire of being diſtinguiſhed and
   remembered for gallant actions; a love of juſtice; and a zealous attachment to their friends and
   their country. Such is the ſtrain of ſentiment in the works of Oſſian.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> the ſublimity of moral ſentiments, if they wanted the ſoftening of the
   tender, would be in hazard of giving a hard and ſtiff air to poetry. It is not enough to admire.
   Admiration is a cold feeling, in compariſon of that deep intereſt which the heart takes in tender
   and pathetic ſcenes; where, by a myſterious attachment to the objects of compaſſion, we are
   pleaſed and delighted, even whilſt we mourn. With ſcenes of this kind Oſſian abounds; and his
   high merit in theſe is inconteſtible. He may be blamed for drawing tears too often from our eyes;
   but that he has the power of commanding them, I believe no man, who as the leaſt ſenſibility,
   will queſtion. The general character of his poetry is the heroic mixed with the elegiac ſtrain;
   admiration tempered with pity. Ever fond of giving, as he expreſſes it, “the joy of grief,” it is
   viſible that, on all moving ſubjects, he delights to exert his genius; and, accordingly, never

   preſent. His great art in managing them lies in giving vent to the ſimple and natural emotions of
   the heart. We meet with no exaggerated declamation; no ſubtile refinements on ſorrow; no
   ſubſtitution of deſcription in place of paſſion. Oſſian felt ſtrongly himſelf; and the heart,
   when uttering its native language, never fails, by powerful ſympathy, to affect the heart. A
   great variety of examples might be produced. We need only open the book to find them everywhere.
   What, for inſtance, can be more moving than the lamentations of Oithona, after her miſfortune?
   Gaul, the ſon of Morni, her lover, ignorant of what ſhe had ſuffered, comes to her reſcue. Their
   meeting is tender in the higheſt degree. He propoſes to engage her foe, in ſingle combat, and
   gives her in charge what ſhe is to do if he himſelf ſhall fall. “And ſhall the daughter of Nuath
   live?” ſhe replied, with a burſting ſigh. “Shall I live in Tromathon, and the ſon of Morni low?
   My heart is not of that rock; nor my ſoul careleſs as that ſea, which lifts its blue waves to

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Oithona</span> mourns like a woman: in Cuthullin's expreſſions of grief after his
   defeat, we behold the ſentiments of a hero—generous, but deſponding. The ſituation is remarkably
   fine. Cuthullin, rouſed from his cave by the noiſe of battle, ſees Fingal victorious in the
   field. He is deſcribed as kindling at the ſight. “His hand is on the ſword of his fathers; his
   red-rolling eyes on the foe. He thrice attempted to ruſh to battle; and thrice did Connal ſtop
   him;” ſuggeſting that Fingal was routing the foe; and that he ought not, by the ſhow of

   to him alone. Cuthullin yields to this generous ſentiment; but we ſee it ſtinging him to the
   heart with the ſenſe of his own diſgrace. “Then, Carril, go,” replied the chief, “and greet the
   king of Morven. When Lochlin fails away like a ſtream after rain, and the noiſe of the battle is
   over, then be thy voice ſweet in his ear, to praiſe the king of ſwords. Give him the ſword of
   Caithbat; for Cuthullin is worthy no more to lift the arms of his fathers. But, O ye ghoſts of
   the lonely Cromla! ye ſouls of chiefs that are no more! be ye the companions of Cuthullin, and
   talk to him in the cave of his ſorrow. For never more ſhall I be renowned among the mighty in the

   morning came, and brightened the ſhaggy ſide of the hill. Connal! talk of arms no more: departed

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Beſides</span> ſuch extended pathetic ſcenes, Oſſian frequently pierces the heart
   by a ſingle unexpected ſtroke. When Oſcar fell in battle, “No father mourned his ſon ſlain in
   youth; no brother, his brother of love; they fell without tears, for the chief of the people was
   low.” In the admirable interview of Hector with Andromache, in the ſixth Iliad, the circumſtance
   of the child in his nurſe's arms, has often been remarked as adding much to the tenderneſs of the
   ſcene. In the following paſſage, relating to the death of Cuthullin, we find a circumſtance that
   muſt ſtrike the imagination with ſtill greater force. “And is the ſon of Semo fallen?” ſaid
   Carril, with a ſigh. “Mournful are Tura's walls, and ſorrow dwells at Dunſcaich. Thy ſpouſe is
   left alone in her youth; the ſon of thy love is alone. He ſhall come to Bragela, and aſk her why
   ſhe weeps? He ſhall lift his eyes to the wall, and ſee his father's ſword. Whoſe ſword is that?
   he will ſay; and the ſoul of his mother is ſad.” Soon after Fingal had ſhown all the grief of a
   father's heart for Ryno, one of his ſons, fallen in battle, he is calling, after his accuſtomed
   manner, his ſons to the chaſe. “Call,” ſays he, “Fillan and Ryno.—But he is not here.—My ſon

   is worthy of the higheſt tragic poet. <span class="quote">

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> contrivance of the incident in both poets is ſimilar: but the
   circumſtances are varied with judgment. Othello dwells upon the name of wife, when it had fallen

   this purpoſe. Nothing can be more poetical and tender, or can leave upon the mind a ſtronger and

   deſcription? Does be paint to the heart as well as to the fancy? Does he make his readers glow,
   and tremble, and weep? Theſe are the great characteriſtics of true poetry. Where theſe are found,
   he muſt be a minute critic, indeed, who can dwell, upon ſlight defects. A few beauties of this
   high kind tranſcend whole volumes of faultleſs mediocrity. Uncouth and abrupt Oſſian may
   ſometimes appear, by reaſon of his conciſeneſs; but he is ſublime, he is pathetic, in an eminent
   degree. If he has not the extenſive knowledge, the regular dignity of narration, the fulneſs and
   accuracy of deſcription, which we find in Homer and Virgil, yet in ſtrength of imagination, in
   grandeur of ſentiment, in native majeſty of paſſion, he is fully their equal. If he flows not
   always like a clear ſtream, yet he breaks forth often like a torrent of fire. Of art, too, he is
   far from being deſtitute; and his imagination is remarkable for delicacy as well as ſtrength.

   <h3 class="normal">ARGUMENT to <span class="sc">Book</span> I.</h3>
   <p class="noindent"> Cairbar, the ſon of Borbar-duthul, lord of Atha in Connaught the moſt potent chief of the
   race of the Firbolg, having murdered, at Temora the royal palace, Cormac the ſon of Artho, the
   young king of Ireland, uſurped the throne. Cormac was lineally deſcended from Conar the ſon of
   Trenmor, the great grandfather of Fingal, king of thoſe Caledonians who inhabited the weſtern
   coaſt of Scotland. Fingal reſented the behaviour of Cairbar, and reſolved to paſs over into
   Ireland, with an army, to re-eſtabliſh the royal family on the Iriſh throne. Early intelligence
   of his deſigns coming to Cairbar, he aſſembled ſome of his tribes in Ulſter, and at the ſame time
   ordered his brother Cathmor to follow him ſpeedily with an army, from Temora. Such was the
   ſituation of affairs when the Caledonian invaders appeared on the coaſt of Ulſter.</p>
   <p class="noindent">The poem opens in the morning. Cairbar is repreſented as retired from the reſt of the army,
   when one of his ſcouts brought him news of the landing of Fingal. He aſſembles a council of his
   chiefs. Foldath the chief of Morna haughtily deſpiſes the enemy ; and is reprimanded warmly by
   Malthos. Cairbar, after hearing their debate, orders a feaſt to be prepared, to which, by his
   bard Olla, he invites Oſcar the ſon of Oſſian ; reſolving to pick a quarrel with that hero, and
   ſo have ſome pretext for killing him. Oſcar came to the feaſt; the quarrel happened ; the
   followers of both fought, and Cairbar and Oſcar fell by mutual wounds. The noiſe of the battle
   reached Fingal's army. The king came on, to the relief of Oſcar, and the Iriſh fell back to the
   army of Cathmor, who was advanced to the banks of the river Lubar, on the heath of Moilena.
   Fingal, after mourning over his grandſon, ordered Ullin the chief of his bards to carry his body
   to Morven, to be there interred. Night coming on, Althan, the ſon of Conachar, relates to the
   king the particulars of the murder of Cormac. Fillan, the ſon of Fingal, is ſent to obſerve the
   motions of Cathmar by night, which concludes the action of the firſt day. The ſcene of this book
   is a plain, near the hill of Mora, which roſe on the borders of the heath of Moilena, in Ulſter. </p>

   Trees ſhake their duſky heads, in the breeze. Grey torrents pour their noiſy ſtreams. Two green

    The grey form of the youth appears in darkneſs. Blood pours from

   are ſhort. He often ſtops. He toſſes his ſinewy arms. He is like a cloud in the deſart, varying
   its form to every blaſt. The valleys are ſad around, and fear, by turns, the ſhower ! The king,
   at length, reſumed his ſoul. He took his pointed ſpear, He turned his eye to Moi-lena, The ſcouts
   of blue ocean came. They came with ſteps of fear, and often looked behind. Cairbar knew that the

 <h3 class="normal">TEMORA: AN EPIC POEM. BOOK II.</h3>
 
  <h3 class="normal">ARGUMENT to Book II.</h3>
  <p class="noindent"> This book opens, we may ſuppoſe, about midnight, with a ſoliloquy of Oſſian, who had retired,
   from the reſt of the army, to mourn for his ſon Oſcar. Upon hearing the noiſe of Cathmor's army
   approaching, he went to find out his brother Fillan, who kept the watch, on the hill of Mora, in
   the front of Fingal's army. In the converſation of the brothers, the epiſode of Conar, the ſon of
   Trenmor, who was the firſt king of Ireland, is introduced, which lays open the origin of the
   conteſts between the Cael and Firbolg, the two nations who firſt poſſeſſed themſelves of that
   iſland. Oſſian kindles a fire on Mora ; upon which Cathmor deſiſted from the deſign he had formed
   of ſurpriſing the army of the Caledonians. He calls a council of his chiefs; reprimands Foldath
   for adviſing a night-attack, as the Iriſh army were ſo much ſuperior in number to the enemy. The
   bard Fonar introduces the ſtory of Crothar, the anceſtor of the king, which throws further light
   on the hiſtory of Ireland, and the original pretenſions of the family of Atha, to the throne of
   that kingdom. The Iriſh chiefs lie down to reſt, and Cathmor himſelf undertakes the watch. In his
   circuit, round the army, he is met by Oſſian. The interview of the two heroes is deſcribed.
   Cathmor obtains a promiſe from Oſſian, to order a funeral elegy to be ſung over the grave of
   Cairbar; it being the opinion of the times, that the ſouls of the dead could not be happy, till
   their elegies were ſung by a bard. Morning comes. Cathmor and Oſſian part; and the latter,
   caſually meeting with Carril the ſon of Kinſena, ſends that bard, with a funeral ſong, to the
   tomb of Cairbar. </p>

   But this is no time, O bard, to ſit down, at the ſtrife of ſong. Fingal is in arms on the vale.
   Thou ſeeft the flaming ſhield of the king. His face darkens between his locks. He beholds the
   wide rolling of Erin. Does not Carril behold that tomb, beſide the roaring ſtream ? Three ſtones
   lift their grey heads, beneath a bending oak. A king is lowly laid ! Give thou his ſoul to the

  <h3 class="normal">ARGUMENT to Book III.</h3>
  <p class="noindent"> <span class="sc">Morning</span> coming on, Fingal, after a ſpeech to his people, devolves the
   command on Gaul, the ſon of Morni ; it being the cuſtom of the times, that the king ſhould not
   engage, till the neceſſity of affairs required his ſuperior valour and conduct. The king and
   Oſſian retire to the rock of Cormul, which overlooked the field of battle. The bards ſing the
   war-ſong. The general conflict is deſcribed. Gaul, the ſon of Morni, diſtinguiſhes himſelf ;
   kills Tur-lathon, chief of Moruth, and other chiefs of leſſer name. On the other hand, Foldath,
   who commanded the Iriſh army (for Cathmor, after the example of Fingal, kept himſelf from battle)
   fights gallantly ; kills Connal, chief of Dun-lora, and advances to engage Gaul himſelf. Gaul, in
   the mean time, being wounded in the hand, by a random arrow, is covered by Fillan, the ſon of
   Fingal, who performs prodigies of valour. Night comes on. The horn of Fingal recalls his army.
   The bards meet them, with a congratulatory ſong, in which the praiſes of Gaul and Fillan are
   particularly celebrated. The chiefs ſit down at a feaſt; Fingal miſſes Connal. The epiſode of
   Connal and Duthcaron is introduced ; which throws further light on the ancient hiſtory of
   Ireland. Carril is diſpatched to raiſe the tomb of Connal. The action of this book takes up the
   ſecond day, from the opening of the poem. </p>

   iſland. The Iriſh chiefs convene in the preſence of Cathmor. The ſituation of the king deſcribed.
   The ſtory of Sul-mala, the daughter of Conmor, king of Inis-huna, who, in the diſguiſe of a young
   warrior, had followed Cathmor to the war. The ſullen behaviour of Foldath, who had commanded in
   the battle of the preceding day, renews the difference between him and Malthos; but Cathmor,
   interpoſing, ends it. The chiefs feaſt, and hear the ſong of Fonar the bard. Cathmor returns to
   reſt, at a diſtance from the army. The ghoſt of his brother Cairbar appears to him in a dream;
   and obſcurely foretels the iſſue of the war. The ſoliloquy of the king. He diſcovers Sul-malla.

  <h3 class="normal">ARGUMENT to Book V.</h3>
  <p class="noindent"> The poet, after a ſhort addreſs to the harp of Cona, deſcribes the arrangement of both armies
   on either ſide of the river Lubar. Fingal gives the command to Fillan ; but, at the ſame time,
   orders Gaul, the ſon of Morni, who had been wounded in the hand in the preceding battle, to
   aſſiſt him with his counſel. The army of the Fir-bolg is commanded by Foldath. The general onſet
   is deſcribed. The great actions of Fillan. He kills Rothmar and Culmin. But when Fillan conquers,
   in one wing, Foldath preſſes hard on the other. He wounds Dermid, the ſon of Duthno, and puts the
   whole wing to flight. Dermid deliberates with himſelf, and, at laſt, reſolves to put a ſtop to
   the progreſs of Foldath, by engaging him in ſingle combat. When the two chiefs were approaching
   towards one another, Fillan came ſuddenly to the relief of Dermid ; engaged Foldath, and killed
   him. The behaviour of Malthos towards the fallen Foldath. Fillan puts the whole army of the
   Fir-bolg to flight. The book cloſes with an addreſs to Clatho, the mother of that hero. </p>

   Cathmor feels the joy of warriors, on his moſſy hill: their joy in ſecret, when dangers rife to

  <h3 class="normal">ARGUMENT to Book VI.</h3>
  <p class="noindent"> <span class="sc">This</span> book opens with a ſpeech of Fingal, who ſees Cathmor deſcending to the
   aſſiſtance of his flying army. The king diſpatches Oſſian to the relief of Fillan. He himſelf
   retires behind the rock of Cormul, to avoid the ſight of the engagement between his ſon and
   Cathmor. Oſſian advances. The deſcent of Cathmor deſcribed. He rallies the army, renews the
   battle, and, before Oſſian could arrive, engages Fillan himſelf. Upon the approach of Oſſian, the
   combat between the two heroes ceaſes. Oſſian and Cathmor prepare to fight, but night coming on
   prevents them. Oſſian returns to the place where Cathmor and Fillan fought. He finds Fillan
   mortally wounded, and leaning againſt a rock. Their diſcourſe. Fillan dies: his body is laid, by
   Oſſian, in a neighbouring cave. The Caledonian army return to Fingal. He queſtions them about his
   ſon, and, underſtanding that he was killed, retires, in ſilence, to the rock of Cormul. Upon the
   retreat of the army of Fingal, the Fir-bolg advance. Cathmor finds Bran, one of the dogs of
   Fingal, lying on the ſhield of Fillan, before the entrance of the cave, where the body of that
   hero lay. His reflections thereupon. He returns, in a melancholy mood, to his army. Malthos
   endeavours to comfort him, by the example of his father Borbar-duthal. Cathmor retires to reſt.
   The ſong of Sul-malla concludes the book, which ends about the middle of the third night, from
   the opening of the poem. </p>

  <p class="noindent"> The fourth morning, from the opening of the poem, comes on. Fingal, ſtill continuing in the
   place, to which he had retired on the preceding night, is ſeen, at intervals, thro' the miſt,
   which covered the rock of Cormul. The deſcent of the king is deſcribed. He orders Gaul, Dermid,
   and Carril the bard, to go to the valley of Cluna, and conduct, from thence, to the Caledonian
   army, Ferad-artho, the ſon of Cairbre, the only perſon remaining of the family of Conar, the
   firſt king of Ireland. The king takes the command of the army, and prepares for battle. Marching
   towards the enemy, he comes to the cave of Lubar, where the body of Fillan lay. Upon ſeeing his
   dog Bran, who lay at the entrance of the cave, his grief returns. Cathmor arranges the Iriſh army
   in order of battle. The appearance of that hero. The general conflict is deſcribed. The actions
   of Fingal and Cathmor. A ſtorm. The total rout of the Firbolg. The two kings engage, in a column
   of miſt, on the banks of Lubar. Their attitude and conference after the combat. The death of
   Cathmor. Fingal reſigns <i>the ſpear of Trenmor</i> to Oſſian. The ceremonies obſerved on that
   occaſion. The ſpirit of Cathmor, in the mean time, appears to Sul-malla, in the valley of Lona.
   Her ſorrow. Evening comes on. A feaſt is prepared. The coming of Ferad-artho is announced by the
   ſongs of a hundred bards. The poem cloſes, with a ſpeech of Fingal. </p>

  <p class="noindent"> <span class="sc">As</span> when the wintry winds have ſeized the waves of the mountain-lake, have
   ſeized them, in ſtormy night, and cloathed them over with ice; white, to the hunter's early eye,
   the billows ſtill ſeem to roll. He turns his ear to the ſound of each unequal ridge. But each is
   ſilent, gleaming, ſtrewn with boughs and tufts of graſs, which ſhake and whiſtle to the wind,
   over their grey ſeats of froſt. So ſilent ſhone to the morning the ridges of Morven's hoſt, as
   each warrior looked up from his helmet towards the hill of the king; the cloud-covered hill of
   Fingal, where he ſtrode, in the folds of miſt. At times is the hero ſeen, greatly dim in all his
   arms.

    From thought to thought rolled the war, along his mighty

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Now</span> is the coming forth of the king. Firſt appeared the ſword of Luno; the
   ſpear half iſſuing from a cloud, the ſhield ſtill dim in miſt. But when the ſtride of the king
   came abroad, with all his grey, dewy locks in the wind ; then roſe the ſhouts of his hoſt over
   every moving tribe. They gathered, gleaming, round, with all their ecchoing ſhields. So riſe the
   green ſeas round a ſpirit, that comes down from the ſqually wind. The traveller hears the ſound
   afar, and lifts his head over the rock. He looks on the troubled bay, and thinks he dimly ſees
   the form. The waves ſport, unwieldy, round, with all their backs of foam.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Far-distant</span> ſtood the ſon of Morni, Duthno's race, and Cona's bard. We ſtood
   far-diſtant ; each beneath his tree. We ſhunned the eyes of the king; we had not conquered in the
   field. A little ſtream rolled at my feet: I touched its light wave, with my ſpear. I touched it
   with my ſpear; nor there was the ſoul of Oſſian. It darkly roſe, from thought to thought, and

    with Cuthóna the daughter of Rumar, when Toſcar the ſon of Kinfena, accompanied by Fercuth his
    friend, arrived, from Ireland, at Mora, where Conlath dwelt. He was hoſpitably received, and
    according to the cuſtom of the times, feaſted, three days, with Conlath. On the fourth he ſet
    ſail, and coaſting the <i>iſland of waves</i>, one of the Hebrides, he ſaw Cuthona hunting,
    fell in love with her, and carried her away, by force, in his ſhip. He was forced, by ſtreſs of
    weather, into I-thona a deſart iſle. In the mean-time Conlath, hearing of the rape, ſailed after
    him, and found him on the point of ſailing for the coaſt of Ireland. They fought; and they and
    their followers fell by mutual wounds. Cuthona did not long ſurvive: for ſhe died of grief the
    third day after. Fingal, hearing of their unfortunate death, ſent Stormal the ſon of Moran to
    bury them, but forgot to ſend a bard to ſing the funeral ſong over their tombs. The ghoſt of
    Conlath comes, long after, to Oſſian, to intreat him to tranſmit, to poſterity, his and
    Cuthona's fame. For it was the opinion of the times, that the ſouls of the deceaſed were not
    happy, till their elegies were compoſed by a bard. </p>

  <p class="noindent"> <span class="sc">Did</span> not Oſſian hear a voice? or is it the ſound of days that are no more?
   Often does the memory of former times come, like the evening ſun, on my ſoul. The noiſe of the
   chace is renewed. In thought, I lift the ſpear. But Oſſian did hear a voice ! Who art thou, ſon
   of night ? The children of the feeble are aſleep. The midnight wind is in my hall. Perhaps it is
   the ſhield of Fingal that ecchoes to the blaſt. It hangs in Oſſian's hall. He feels it ſometimes
   with his hands. Yes! I hear thee, my friend ! Long has thy voice been abſent from mine ear ! What
   brings thee, on thy cloud, to Oſſian, ſon of generous Morni? Are the friends of the aged near
   thee? Where is Oſcar, ſon of fame? He was often near thee, O Conlath, when the ſound of battle
   aroſe.</p>

   <p class="noindent"> Fingal in his voyage to Lochlin, whither he had been invited by Starno the father of
    Agandecca, touched at Berrathon, an iſland of Scandinavia, where he was kindly entertained by
    Larthmor the petty king of the place, who was a vaſſal of the ſupreme kings of Lochlin. The
    hoſpitality of Larthmor gained him Fingal's friendſhip, which that hero manifeſted, after the
    impriſonment of Larthmor by his own ſon, by ſending Oſſian and Toſcar, the father of Malvina ſo
    often mentioned, to reſcue Larthmor, and to puniſh the unnatural behaviour of Uthal. Uthal was
    handſome, and, by the ladies, much admired. Nina-thoma, the beautiful daughter of Torthoma, a
    neighbouring prince, fell in love and fled with him. He proved unconſtant; for another lady,
    whoſe name is not mentioned, gaining his affections, he confined Nina-thoma to a deſart iſland
    near the coaſt of Berrathon. She was relieved by Oſſian, who, in company with Toſcar, landing on
    Berrathon, defeated the forces of Uthal, and killed him in a ſingle combat. Nina-thoma, whoſe
    love not all the bad behaviour of Uthal could eraſe, hearing of his death, died of grief. In the
    mean time Larthmor is reſtored, and Oſſian and Toſcar return in triumph to Fingal,</p>

  <p class="noindent"> <span class="sc">Inquiries</span> into the antiquities of nations afford more pleaſure than any
   real advantage to mankind. The ingenious may form ſyſtems of hiſtory on probabilities and a few
   facts; but at a great diſtance of time, their accounts muſt be vague and uncertain. The infancy
   of ſtates and kingdoms is as deſtitute of great events, as of the means of tranſmitting them to
   poſterity: The arts of poliſhed life, by which alone facts can be preſerved with certainty, are
   the production of a well-formed community. It is then hiſtorians begin to write, and public
   tranſactions to be worthy remembrance. The actions of former times are left in obſcurity, or
   magnified by uncertain traditions, Hence it is that we find ſo

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> Greeks and Romans were remarkable for this weakneſs. They ſwallowed the

   however, roſe very early amongſt them, and tranſmitted, with luſtre, their great actions to
   poſterity. It is to them that they owe that unrivalled fame they now enjoy, while the great
   actions of other nations are involved in fables, or loſt in obſcurity. The Celtic nations afford
   a ſtriking inſtance of this kind, They, though once the maſters of Europe from the mouth of the

   of their bards, which, by the viciſſitude of human affairs, are long ſince loſt. Their ancient
   language is the only monument that remains of them ; and the traces of it being ſound in places
   ſo widely diſtant from each other, ſerves only to ſhew the extent of their ancient power, but

   but even the ancient Germans themſelves were Gauls. The preſent Germans, properly ſo called, were

   but their language different. The Germans<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753334576544"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a> are the genuine deſcendants of the ancient Scandinavians, who

    monarchy, as it was in all the countries where the Druids bore the
   chief ſway. This order of men ſeems to have been formed on the ſame principles with the Dactyli
   Idæi and Curetes of the ancients. Their pretended intercourſe with heaven, their magic and
   divination were the ſame. The knowlege of the Druids in natural cauſes, and the properties of
   certain things, the fruit of the experiments of ages, gained them a mighty reputation among the
   people. The eſteem of the populace ſoon increaſed into a veneration for the order; which theſe
   cunning and ambitious prieſts took care to improve, to ſuch a degree, that they, in a manner,
   ingroſſed the management of civil, as well as religious, matters. It is generally allowed that
   they did not abuſe this extraordinary power ; the preſerving their character of ſanctity was ſo
   eſſential to their influence, that they never broke out into violence or oppreſſion. The chiefs
   were allowed to execute the laws, but the legiſlative power was entirely in the hands of the
   Druids<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753334568448"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>. It was by their authority that the tribes were united, in times of the

    enjoyed long this extraordinary privilege among the
   Celtic nations who lay beyond the pale of the Roman empire. It was in the beginning of the ſecond
   century that their power among the Caledonians begun to decline. The traditions concerning
   Trathal and Cormac, anceſtors to Fingal, are full of the particulars of the fall of the Druids: a
   fingular fate, it muſt be owned, of prieſts, who had once eſtabliſhed their ſuperſtition !</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> continual wars of the Caledonians againſt the Romans hindered the better
   ſort from initiating themſelves, as the cuſtom formerly was, into the order of the Druids. The
   precepts of their religion were confined to a few, and were not much attended to by a people
   inured to war. The Vergobretus, or chief magiſtrate, was choſen without the concurrence of the
   hierarchy, or continued in his office againſt their will. Continual power ſtrengthened his
   intereſt among the tribes, and enabled him to ſend down, as hereditary to his poſterity, the
   office he had only received himſelf by election.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">On</span> occaſion of a new war againſt the <i>King of the World</i>, as
   tradition emphatically calls the Roman emperor, the Druids, to vindicate the honour of the order,
   began to reſume their ancient privilege of chuſing the Vergobretus. Garmal, the ſon of Tarno,

    them, came to the grandfather of the celebrated Fingal, who was then
   Vergobretus, and commanded him, in the name of the whole order, to lay down his office. Upon his
   refuſal, a civil war commenced, which ſoon ended in almoſt the total extinction of the religious
   order of the Druids. A few that remained, retired to the dark receſſes of their groves, and the
   caves they had formerly uſed for their meditations. It is then we find them in <i>the circle of
   ſtones</i>, and unheeded by the world. A total diſregard for the order, and utter abhorrence of
   the Druidical rites enſued. Under this cloud of public hate, all that had any knowlege of the
   religion of the Druids became extinct, and the nation fell into the laft degree of ignorance of
   their rites and ceremonies.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">It</span> is no matter of wonder then, that Fingal and his ſon Oſſian diſliked the
   Druids, who were the declared enemies to their ſucceſſion in the ſupreme magiſtracy. It is a
   fingular caſe, it muſt be allowed, that there are no traces of religion in the poems aſcribed to
   Oſſian ; as the poetical compoſitions of other nations are fo cloſely connected with their
   mythology. But gods are not neceſſary, when the poet has genius. It is hard to account for it to
   thoſe who are not made acquainted with the manner of the old Scottiſh

    bards. That race of men carried their notions of
   martial honour to an extravagant pitch. Any aid given their heroes in battle, was thought to
   derogate from their fame ; and the bards immediately transferred the glory of the action to him
   who had given that aid.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Had</span> the poet brought down gods, as often as Homer hath done, to aſſiſt his
   heroes, his work had not conſiſted of eulogiums on men, but of hymns to ſuperior beings. Thoſe
   who write in the Galic language ſeldom mention religion in their profane poetry ; and when they
   profeſſedly write of religion, they never mix with their compoſitions, the actions of their
   heroes, This cuſtom alone, even though the religion of the Druids had not been previouſly
   extinguiſhed, may, in ſome meaſure, excuſe the author's ſilence concerning the religion of
   ancient times.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">To</span> allege, that a nation is void of all religion, would betray ignorance of
   the hiſtory of mankind. The traditions of their fathers, and their own obſervations on the works
   of nature, together with that ſuperſtition which is inherent in the human frame, have, in all
   ages, raiſed in the minds of men ſome idea of a ſuperior being. Hence it is, that in the darkeſt

    notion, at leaſt, of a divinity. The Indians, who worſhip no God,
   believe that he exiſts. It would be doing injuſtice to the author of theſe poems, to think, that
   he had not opened his conceptions to that primitive and greateſt of all truths. But let his
   religion be what it will, it is certain he has not alluded to Chriſtianity, or any of its rites,
   in his poems ; which ought to fix his opinions, at leaſt, to an æra prior to that religion.
   Conjectures, on this ſubject, muſt ſupply the place of proof. The perſecution begun by
   Dioclefian, in the year 303, is the moſt probable time in which the firſt dawning of Chriſtianity
   in the north of Britain can be fixed. The humane and mild character of Conſtantius Chlorus, who
   commanded then in Britain, induced the perſecuted Chriftians to take refuge under him. Some of
   them, through a zeal to propagate their tenets, or through fear, went beyond the pale of the
   Roman empire, and ſettled among the Caledonians; who were ready to hearken to their doctrines, if
   the religion of the Druids was exploded long before.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">These</span> miſſionaries, either through choice, or to give more weight to the
   doctrine they advanced, took poſſeſſion of the cells and groves of the Druids; and it was from
   this retired life they had the name of <i>Culdees</i><a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753334546192"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>, which in the

    language of the country ſignified <i>ſequeſtered
   perſons</i>. It was with one of the <i>Culdees</i> that Oſſian, in his extreme old age, is
   ſaid to have diſputed concerning the Chriftian religion. This diſpute, they ſay, is extant, and
   is couched in verſe, according to the cuſtom of the times. The extreme ignorance on the part of
   Oſſian, of the Chriſtian tenets, ſhews, that that religion had only been lately introduced, as it
   is not eafy to conceive, how one of the firſt rank could be totally unacquainted with a religion
   that had been known for any time in the country. The diſpute bears the genuine marks of
   antiquity. The obſolete phraſes and expreſſions peculiar to the times, prove it to be no forgery.
   If Oſſian then lived at the introduction of Chriſtianity, as by all appearance he did, his epoch
   will be the latter end of the third, and beginning of the fourth century. Tradition here ſteps in

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> the year 210 the emperor Severus, after returning from his expedition
   againſt the Caledonians, at York fell into the tedious illneſs of which he afterwards died. The
   Caledonians and Maiatæ, reſuming courage from his indiſpoſition, took arms in order to recover
   the poſſeſſions they had loſt. The enraged emperor commanded his army to march into their
   country, and to deſtroy it with fire and ſword. His orders were but ill executed, for his ſon,
   Caracalla, was at the head of the army, and his thoughts were entirely taken up with the hopes of
   his father's death, and with ſchemes to ſupplant his brother Geta. --- He ſcarcely had entered
   the enemy's country, when news was brought him that Severus was dead. --- A ſudden peace is
   patched up with the Caledonians, and, as it appears from Dion Caſſius, the country they had loſt
   to Severus was reſtored to them.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> Caracul of Fingal is no other than Caracalla, who, as the ſon of
   Severus, the Emperor of Rome, whoſe dominions were extended almoſt over the known world, was not
   without reaſon called <i>the Son of the King of the world</i>. The ſpace of time between 211,
   the year Severus died, and the beginning of the fourth century, is not ſo great, but Oſſian the

    perſecution under Diocleſian had driven beyond the
   pale of the Roman empire.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> one of the many lamentations on the death of Oſcar, a battle which he
   fought againſt Caros, king of ſhips, on the banks of the winding Carun<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753334528752"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>, is mentioned among his great actions. It is
   more than probable, that the Caros mentioned here, is the ſame with the noted uſurper Caraufius,
   who aſſumed the purple in the year 287, and ſeizing on Britain, defeated the emperor Maximian
   Herculius, in ſeveral naval engagements, which gives propriety to his being called <i>the King
   of Ships</i>. The <i>winding Carun</i> is that ſmall river retaining ſtill the name of Carron,
   and runs in the neighbourhood of Agricola's wall, which Carauſius repaired to obſtruct the
   incurſions of the Caledonians. Several other paſſages in traditions allude to the wars of the
   Romans ; but the two juſt mentioned clearly fix the epocha of Fingal to the third century ; and
   this account agrees exactly with the Iriſh hiſtories, which place the death of Fingal, the ſon of
   Comhal, in the year 283, and that of Oſcar and their own celebrated Cairbre, in the year 296.</p>

    by tradition, from learned men, more than from ancient poems. This
   muſt then have happened at leaſt three ages ago, as theſe alluſions are mentioned often in the
   compoſitions of thoſe times.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Every</span> one knows what a cloud of ignorance and barbariſm overſpread the north
   of Europe three hundred years ago. The minds of men, addicted to ſuperſtition, contracted a
   narrowneſs that deſtroyed genius. Accordingly we find the compoſitions of thoſe times trivial and
   puerile to the laſt degree. But let it be allowed, that, amidſt all the untoward circumſtances of
   the age, a genius might ariſe, it is not eaſy to determine what could induce him to allude to the
   Roman times. We find no fact to favour any deſigns which could be entertained by any man who
   lived in the fifteenth century.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſtrongeſt objection to the antiquity of the poems now given to the
   public under the name of Oſſian, is the improbability of their being handed down by tradition
   through ſo many centuries. Ages of barbariſm ſome will ſay, could not produce poems abounding
   with the diſintereſted and generous ſentiments ſo conſpicuous in the compoſitions of Oſſian; and
   could theſe ages produce them, it is impoſſible but they muſt be loſt, or altogether corrupted in

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">These</span> objections naturally ſuggeſt themſelves to men unacquainted with the
   ancient ſtate of the northern parts of Britain. The bards, who were an inferior order of the
   Druids, did not ſhare their bad fortune. They were ſpared by the victorious king, as it was
   through their means only he could hope for immortality to his fame. They attended him in the
   camp, and contributed to eſtabliſh his power by their ſongs. His great actions were magnified,
   and the populace, who had no ability to examine into his character narrowly, were dazzled with
   his fame in the rhimes of the bards. In the mean time, men aſſumed ſentiments that are rarely to
   be met with in an age of barbariſm. The bards who were originally the diſciples of the Druids,
   had their minds opened, and their ideas enlarged, by being initiated in the learning of that
   celebrated order. They could form a perfect hero in their own minds, and aſcribe that character
   to their prince. The inferior chiefs made this ideal character the model of their conduct, and by
   degrees brought their minds to that generous ſpirit which breathes in all the poetry of the
   times. The prince, flattered by his bards, and rivalled by his own heroes, who imitated his
   character as deſcribed in the eulogies of his poets, endeavoured to excel his people in merit,

    as he was above them in ſtation. This emulation continuing, formed at
   laſt the general character of the nation, happily compounded of what is noble in barbarity, and
   virtuous and generous in a poliſhed people.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">When</span> virtue in peace, and bravery in war, are the characteriſtics of a
   nation, their actions become intereſting, and their fame worthy of immortality. A generous ſpirit
   is warmed with noble actions, and becomes ambitious of perpetuating them. This is the true ſource
   of that divine inſpiration, to which the poets of all ages pretended. When they found their
   themes inadequate to the warmth of their imaginations, they varniſhed them over with fables,
   ſupplied by their own fancy, or furniſhed by abſurd traditions. Theſe fables, however ridiculous,
   had their abettors; poſterity either implicitly believed them, or through a vanity natural to
   mankind, pretended that they did. They loved to place the founders of their families in the days
   of fable, when poetry, without the fear of contradiction, could give what characters ſhe pleaſed
   of her heroes. It is to this vanity that we owe the preſervation of what remain of the more
   ancient poems. Their poetical merit made their heroes famous in a country where heroiſm was much
   eſteemed and admired. The poſterity of thoſe

    heroes, or thoſe who pretended to be deſcended from
   them, heard with pleaſure the eulogiums of their anceſtors ; bards were employed to repeat the
   poems, and to record the connection of their patrons with chiefs ſo renowned. Every chief in
   proceſs of time had a bard in his family, and the office became at laſt hereditary. By the
   ſucceſſion of theſe bards, the poems concerning the anceſtors of the family were handed down from
   generation to generation; they were repeated to the whole clan on ſolemn occaſions, and always
   alluded to in the new compoſitions of the bards. This cuſtom came down to near our own times; and
   after the bards were diſcontinued, a great number in a clan retained by memory, or committed to
   writing, their compoſitions, and founded the antiquity of their families on the authority of
   their poems.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> uſe of letters was not known in the north of Europe till long after the
   inſtitution of the bards : the records of the families of their patrons, their own, and more
   ancient poems were handed down by tradition. Their poetical compoſitions were admirably contrived
   for that purpoſe. They were adapted to muſic; and the moſt perfect harmony was obſerved. Each
   verſe was ſo connected with thoſe which preceded or followed it, that if one line had been

    remembered in a ſtanza, it was almoſt impoſſible to forget the reſt.
   The cadences followed in ſo natural a gradation, and the words were ſo adapted to the common turn
   of the voice, after it is raiſed to a certain key, that it was almoſt impoſſible, from a
   ſimilarity of ſound, to ſubſtitute one word for another. This excellence is peculiar to the
   Celtic tongue, and is perhaps to be met with in no other language. Nor does this choice of words
   clog the ſenſe or weaken the expreſſion. The numerous flections of conſonants, and variation in
   declenſion, make the language very copious.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> deſcendants of the Celtæ, who inhabited Britain and its iſles, were not
   ſingular in this method of preſerving the moſt precious monuments of their nation. The ancient
   laws of the Greeks were couched in verſe, and handed down by tradition. The Spartans, through a
   long habit, became ſo fond of this cuſtom, that they would never allow their laws to be committed
   to writing. The actions of great men, and the eulogiums of kings and heroes, were preſerved in
   the ſame manner. All the hiſtorical monuments of the old Germans were comprehended in their
   ancient ſongs<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753334503472"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>! which were either hymns to their gods, or elegies in

    and were intended to perpetuate the great events in
   their nation which were carefully interwoven with them. This ſpecies of compoſition was not
   committed to writing, but delivered by oral tradition<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753334500688"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>. The care they took to
   have the poems taught to their children, the uninterrupted cuſtom of repeating them upon certain
   occaſions, and the happy meaſure of the verſe, ſerved to preſerve them for a long time
   uncorrupted. This oral chronicle of the Germans was not forgot in the eighth century, and it
   probably would have remained to this day, had not learning, which thinks every thing, that is not
   committed to writing, fabulous, been introduced. It was from poetical traditions that Garcillaſſo
   compoſed his account of the Yncas of Peru. The Peruvians had loft all other monuments of their
   hiſtory, and it was from ancient poems which his mother, a princeſs of the blood of the Yncas,
   taught him in his youth, that he collected the materials of his hiſtory. If other nations then,
   that had been often overrun by enemies, and had ſent abroad and received colonies, could, for
   many ages, preſerve, by oral tradition, their laws and hiſtories uncorrupted, it is much more
   probable that the ancient Scots, a people ſo free of intermixture

    with foreigners, and ſo ſtrongly attached to the memory of their
   anceſtors, had the works of their bards handed down with great purity.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">What</span> is advanced, in this ſhort Diſſertation, it muſt be confeſſed, is mere
   conjecture. Beyond the reach of records, is ſettled a gloom, which no ingenuity can penetrate.
   The manners deſcribed, in theſe poems, ſuit the ancient Celtic times, and no other period, that
   is known in hiſtory. We muſt, therefore, place the heroes far back in antiquity; and it matters
   little, who were their contemporaries in other parts of the world. If we have placed Fingal in
   his proper period, we do honour to the manners of barbarous times. He exercifed every manly
   virtue in Caledonia, while Heliogabalus diſgraced human nature at Rome. </p>

   is leſs known than their manners. Deſtitute of the uſe of letters, they themſelves had not the
   means of tranſmitting their great actions to remote poſterity. Foreign writers ſaw them only at a

    this ſubject. Having early imbibed their idea of
   exalted manners from the Greek and Roman writers, they ſcarcely ever afterwards have the
   fortitude to allow any dignity of character to any nation deſtitute of the uſe of letters.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Without</span> derogating from the fame of Greece and Rome, we may conſider
   antiquity beyond the pale of their empire worthy of ſome attention. The nobler paſſions of the
   mind never ſhoot forth more free and unreſtrained than in the times we call barbarous. That
   irregular manner of life, and thoſe manly purſuits from which barbarity takes its name, are
   highly favorable to a ſtrength of mind unknown in poliſhed times. In advanced ſociety the
   characters of men are more uniform and diſguiſed. The human paſſions lie in ſome degree concealed
   behind forms, and artificial manners; and the powers of the ſoul, without an opportunity of
   exerting them, loſe their vigor. The times of regular government, and poliſhed manners, are
   therefore to be wiſhed for by the feeble and weak in mind. An unſettled ſtate, and thoſe
   convulſions which attend it, is the proper field for an exalted character, and the exertion of
   great parts. Merit there riſes always ſuperior ; no fortuitous event can raiſe the timid and mean
   into power. To thoſe who look upon antiquity in this light,

    it is an agreeable proſpect ; and they alone can have real pleaſure
   in tracing nations to their ſource.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> eſtabliſhment of the Celtic ſtates, in the north of Europe, is beyond
   the reach of written annals. The traditions and ſongs to which they truſted their hiſtory, were
   loſt, or altogether corrupted in their revolutions and migrations, which were ſo frequent and
   univerſal, that no kingdom in Europe is now poſſefed by its original inhabitants. Societies were
   formed, and kingdoms erected, from a mixture of nations, who, in proceſs of time, loſt all
   knowlege of their own origin. If tradition could be depended upon, it is only among a people,
   from all time, free from intermixture with foreigners. We are to look for theſe among the
   mountains and inacceſfible parts of a country : places, on account of their barrenneſs,
   uninviting to an enemy, or whoſe natural ſtrength enabled the natives to repel invaſions. Such
   are the inhabitants of the mountains of Scotland. We, accordingly, find, that they differ
   materially from thoſe who poſſeſs the low and more fertile part of the kingdom. Their language is
   pure and original, and their manners are thoſe of an ancient and unmixed race of men. Conſcious

    people. As they lived in a country only fit for
   paſture, they were free from that toil and buſineſs, which engroſs the attention of a commercial
   people. Their amuſement conſiſted in hearing or repeating their ſongs and traditions, and theſe
   intirely turned on the antiquity of their nation, and the exploits of their forefathers. It is no
   wonder, therefore, that there are more remains of antiquity among them, than among any other
   people in Europe. Traditions, however, concerning remote periods, are only to be regarded, in ſo
   far as they co-incide with cotemporary writers of undoubted credit and veracity.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">No</span> writers began their accounts from a more early period, than the
   hiſtorians of the Scots nation. Without records, or even tradition itſelf, they give a long liſt
   of ancient kings, and a detail of their tranſactions, with a ſcrupulous exactneſs. One might
   naturally ſuppoſe, that, when they had no authentic annals, they ſhould, at leaſt, have recourſe
   to the traditions of their country, and have reduced them into a regular ſyſtem of hiſtory. Of
   both they ſeem to have been equally deſtitute. Born in the low country, and ſtrangers to the
   ancient language of their nation, they contented themſelves with copying from one another, and
   retailing the ſame fictions, in a new colour and dreſs.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">John Fordunn</span> was the firſt who collected thoſe fragments of the Scots
   hiſtory, which had eſcaped the brutal policy of Edward I. and reduced them into order. His
   accounts, in ſo far as they concerned recent tranſactions, deſerved credit : beyond a certain
   period, they were fabulous and unſatisfactory. Some time before Fordun wrote, the king of
   England, in a letter to the pope, had run up the antiquity of his nation to a very remote æra.
   Fordun, poſſeſſed of all the national prejudice of the age, was unwilling that his country ſhould
   yield, in point of antiquity, to a people, then its rivals and enemies. Deſtitute of annals in
   Scotland, he had recourſe to Ireland, which, according to the vulgar errors of the times, was
   reckoned the firſt habitation of the Scots. He found, there, that the Iriſh bards had carried
   their pretenſions to antiquity as high, if not beyond any nation in Europe. It was from them he
   took thoſe improbable fictions, which form the firſt part of his hiſtory.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> writers that ſucceeded Fordun implicitly followed his ſyſtem, though
   they ſometimes varied from him in their relations of particular tranſactions, and the order of
   ſucceſſion of their kings. As they had no new lights, and were, equally with him, unacquainted

    traditions of their country, their hiſtories contain
   little information concerning the origin of the Scots. Even Buchanan himſelf, except the elegance
   and vigour of his ſtile, has very little to recommend him. Blinded with political prejudices, he
   ſeemed more anxious to turn the fictions of his predeceſſors to his own purpoſes, than to detect
   their miſrepreſentations, or inveſtigate truth amidſt the darkneſs which they had thrown round
   it. It therefore appears, that little can be collected from their own hiſtorians, concerning the
   firſt migration of the Scots into Britain. </p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">That</span> this iſland was peopled from Gaul admits of no doubt. Whether colonies
   came afterwards from the north of Europe is a matter of meer ſpeculation. When South-Britain
   yielded to the power of the Romans, the unconquered nations to the north of the province were
   diſtinguiſhed by the name of <i>Caledonians</i>. From their very name, it appears, that they
   were of thoſe Gauls, who poſſeſſed themſelves originally of Britain. It is compounded of two
   <i>Celtic</i> words, <i>Caël</i> ſignifying <i>Celts</i>, or <i>Gauls</i>, and
   <i>Dun</i> or <i>Don</i>, a hill; ſo that <i>Caël-don</i>, or Caledonians, is as much as to
   ſay, the <i>Celts of the hill country</i>. The Highlanders, to this day, call themſelves

   <i>Caledonia</i>. This, of itſelf, is ſufficient to demonſtrate, they are the genuine
   deſcendents of the ancient Caledonians, and not a pretended colony of <i>Scots</i>, who ſettled
   firſt in the north, in the third or fourth century.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">From</span> the double meaning of the word <i>Caël</i>, which ſignifies
   <i>ſtrangers</i>, as well as <i>Gauls</i>,or <i>Celts</i>, ſome have imagined, that the
   anceſtors of the Caledonians were of a different race from the reſt of the Britons, and that they
   received their name upon that account. This opinion, ſay they, is ſupported by Tacitus, who, from
   ſeveral circumſtances, concludes, that the Caledonians were of German extraction. A diſcuſſion of
   a point ſo intricate, at this diſtance of time, could neither be fatisfaſtory nor important.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Towards</span> the latter end of the third, and beginning of the fourth century, we

   the Scots were not heard of before that period, moſt writers ſuppoſed them to have been a colony,

    Caledonians, in proceſs of time, became naturally
   divided into two diſtinct nations, as poſſeſſing parts of the country, intirely different in
   their nature and ſoil. The weſtern coaſt of Scotland is hilly and barren ; towards the eaſt the
   country is plain, and fit for tillage. The inhabitants of the mountains, a roving and
   uncontrouled race of men, lived by feeding of cattle, and what they killed in hunting. Their
   employment did not fix them to one place. They removed from one heath to another, as ſuited beſt
   with their convenience or inclination. They were not, therefore, improperly called, by their
   neighbours, <span class="sc">Scuite</span>, or <i>the wandering nation</i> ; wiuch is evidently the
   origin of the Roman name of <i>Scoti</i>.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">On</span> the other hand, the Caledonians, who poſſeſſed the eaſt coaſt of
   Scotland, as the diviſion of the country was plain and fertile, applied themſelves to
   agriculture, and raiſing of corn. It was from this, that the Galic name of the <i>Picts</i>
   proceeded; for they are called, in that language, <i>Cruithnich</i>, i. e. <i>the wheat or
   corn-eaters</i>. As the Picts lived in a country ſo different in its nature from that poſſeſſed
   by the Scots, ſo their national character ſuffered a material change. Unobſtructed by mountains,
   or lakes, their communication with one another was free and frequent.

    Society, therefore, became ſooner eſtabliſhed among them, than
   among the Scots, and, conſequently, they were much ſooner governed by civil magiſtrates and laws.
   This, at laſt, produced ſo great a difference in the manners of the two nations, that they began
   to forget their common origin, and almoſt continual quarrels and animoſities ſubſiſted between
   them. Theſe animoſities, after ſome ages, ended in the ſubverſion of the Pictiſh kingdom, but not
   in the total extirpation of the nation, according to moſt of the Scots writers, who ſeemed to
   think it more for the honour of their countrymen to annihilate, than reduce a rival people under
   their obedience. It is certain, however, that the very name of the Picts was loſt, and thoſe that
   remained were ſo completely incorporated with their conquerors, that they ſoon loſt all memory of
   their own origin.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> end of the Pictiſh government is placed ſo near that period, to which
   authentic annals reach, that it is matter of wonder, that we have no monuments of their language
   or hiſtory remaining. This favours the ſyſtem I have laid down. Had they originally been of a
   different race from the Scots, their language of courſe would be different. The contrary is the
   caſe. The names of places in the Pictiſh dominions,

    and the very names of their kings, which are handed
   down to us, are of Galic original, which is a convincing proof, that the two nations were, of
   old, one and the ſame, and only divided into two governments, by the effect which their ſituation
   had upon the genius of the people.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> name of <i>Picts</i> is ſaid to have been given by the Romans to the
   Caledonians, who poſſeſſed the eaſt coaſt of Scotland, from their painting their bodies. The
   ſtory is ſilly and the argument abſurd. But let us revere antiquity in her very follies. This
   circumſtance made ſome imagine, that the Picts were of Britiſh extract, and a different race of
   men from the Scots. That more of the Britons, who fled northward from the tyranny of the Romans,
   ſettled in the low country of Scotland, than among the Scots of the mountains, may be eaſily
   imagined, from the very nature of the country. It was they who introduced painting among the
   Picts. From this circumſtance, affirm ſome antiquaries, proceeded the name of the latter, to
   diſtinguiſh them from the Scots, who never had that art among them, and from the Britons, who
   diſcontinued it after the Roman conqueſt.</p>

    the ſea, and, in iſlands, divided, one from another, by wide and
   dangerous firths. It is, therefore, highly probable, that they, very early, found their way to
   the north of Ireland, which is within ſight of their own country. That Ireland was firſt peopled
   from Britain is, at length, a matter that admits of no doubt. The vicinity of the two iſlands;
   the exact correſpondence of the ancient inhabitants of both, in point of manners and language,
   are ſufficient proofs, even if we had not the teſtimony of<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753334429552"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a> authors of undoubted veracity to confirm it. The abettors of the
   moſt romantic ſyſtems of Iriſh antiquities allow it; but they place the colony from Britain in an
   improbable and remote æra. I ſhall eaſily admit, that the colony of the <i>Firbolg</i>,
   confeſſedly the Belgæ of Britain, ſettled in the ſouth of Ireland, before the Caël, or
   Caledonians, diſcovered the north; but it is not at all likely, that the migration of the Firbolg
   to Ireland happened many centuries before the chriſtian æra.</p>

    inhabitants of Ireland, that eyery unbiaſſed perſon
   will confeſs them more probable, than the legends handed down, by tradition, in that country. It
   appears, that, in the days of Trathal, grandfather to Fingal, Ireland was poſſeſſed by two
   nations; the <i>Firbolg</i> or <i>Belgæ</i> of Britain, who inhabited the ſouth, and the
   Caël, who paſſed over from Caledonia and the Hebrides to Ulfter. The two nations, as is uſual
   among an unpoliſhed and lately ſettled people, were divided into ſmall dynaſties, ſubject to
   petty kings, or chiefs, independent of one another. In this ſituation, it is probable, they
   continued long, without any material revolution in the ſtate of the iſland, until Crothar, Lord
   of Atha, a country in Connaught, the moſt potent chief of the <i>Firbolg</i>, carried away
   Conlama, the daughter of Cathmin, a chief of the Caël, who poſſeſſed Ulſter.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Conlama</span> had been betrothed ſome time before to Turloch, a chief of their own
   nation. Turloch reſented the affront offered him by Crothar, made an irruption into Connaught,
   and killed Cormul, the brother of Crothar, who came to oppoſe his progreſs. Crothar himſelf then
   took arms, and either killed or expelled Turloch. The war, upon this, became general, between the
   two nations: and the Caël were

    reduced to the laſt extremity. In this ſituation, they applied, for
   aid, to Trathal king of Morven, who ſent his brother Conar, already famous for his great
   exploits, to their relief. Conar, upon his arrival in Ulfter, was choſen king, by the unanimous
   conſent of the Caledonian tribes, who poſſeſſed that country. The war was renewed with vigour and
   ſucceſs; but the Firbolg appear to have been rather repelled than ſubdued. In ſucceeding reigns,
   we learn from epiſodes in the ſame poem, that the chiefs of Atha made ſeveral efforts to become
   monarchs of Ireland, and to expel the race of Conar.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">To</span> Conar ſucceeded his ſon Cormac, who appears to have reigned long. In his
   latter days he ſeems to have been driven to the laſt extremity, by an inſurrection of the
   <i>Firbolg</i>, who ſupported the pretenſions of the chiefs of Atha to the Iriſh throne.
   Fingal, who then was very young, came to the aid of Cormac, totally defeated Colc-ulla, chief of
   Atha, and re-eſtabliſhed Cormac in the ſole poſſeſſion of all Ireland. It was then he fell in

   pretenflons to the Iriſh throne, rebelled in the minority of Cormac, defeated his adherents, and
   murdered him in the palace of Temora. Cairbar, lord of Atha, upon this, mounted the throne. His
   uſurpation ſoon ended with his life; for Fingal made an expedition into Ireland, and reſtored,
   after various viciſſitudes of fortune, the family of Conar to the poſſeſſion of the kingdom. This
   war is the ſubject of Temora; the events, though certainly heightened and embelliſhed by poetry,
   ſeem, notwithſtanding, to have their ſoundation in true hiſtory.</p>

   the firſt king of Ireland, we can form no judgment of the time of the ſettlement of the Firbolg.
   It is, however, probable, it was ſome time before the Caël, or Caledonians, ſettled in Ulfter.
   One important fact may be gathered from this hiſtory, that the Iriſh had no king before the
   latter end of the firſt century. Fingal lived, it is ſuppoſed, in the third century ; ſo Conar,
   the firſt monarch of the Iriſh, who was his grand-uncle, cannot be placed farther back than the
   cloſe of the firſt. To eſtabliſh this fact, is to lay, at once, aſide the pretended antiquities
   of the Scots and Iriſh, and to get quit of the long liſt of kings which the latter give us for a
   millennium before.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Of</span> the affairs of Scotiand, it is certain, nothing can be depended upon,
   prior to the reign of Fergus, the ſon of Erc, who lived in the fifth century. The true hiſtory of

    this conſideration, that he begins his hiſtory at the
   introduction of Chriſtianity, remarking, that all that is delivered down, concerning the times of

   Such being the opinion of Ware, who had collected with uncommon induſtry and zeal, all the real

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Concerning</span> the period of more than a century, which intervenes between
   Fingal and the reign of Fergus, the ſon of Erc or Arcath, tradition is dark and contradictory.
   Some trace up the family of Fergus to a ſon of Fingal of that name, who makes a conſiderable
   figure in Oſſian's poems. The three elder ſons of Fingal, Oſſian, Fillan, and Ryno, dying without
   iſſue, the ſucceſſion, of courſe, devolved upon Fergus, the fourth ſon and his poſterity. This
   Fergus, ſay ſome traditions, was the father of Congal, whoſe ſon was Arcath, the father of
   Fergus, properly called the firſt king of Scots, as it was in his time the <i>Caël</i>, who
   poſſeſſed the weſtern coaft of Scotland, began to be diſtinguiſhed, by foreigners, by the name of
   <i>Scots</i> From thenceforward, the Scots and Picts, as diftinct nations, became objects of
   attention to the hiſtorians of other countries. The internal ſtate of the two Caledonian kingdoms
   has always continued, and ever muſt remain, in obſcurity and fable.</p>

    ſtages in human ſociety. The firſt is the reſult of
   conſanguinity, and the natural affection of the members of a family to one another. The ſecond
   begins when property is eſtabliſhed, and men enter into aſſociations for mutual defence, againſt
   the invaſions and injuſtice of neighbours. Mankind ſubmit, in the third, to certain laws and
   ſubordinations of government, to which they truſt the ſafety of their perſons and property. As
   the firft is formed on nature, ſo, of courſe, it is the moſt diſintereſted and noble. Men, in the
   laſt, have leiſure to cultivate the mind, and to reſtore it, with reflection, to a primæval
   dignity of ſentiment. The middle ſtate is the region of complete barbariſm and ignorance. About
   the beginning of the fifth century, the Scots and Picts were advanced into the ſecond ſtage, and,
   conſequently, into thoſe circumſcribed ſentiments, which always diſtinguiſh barbarity. The events
   which ſoon after happened did not at all contribute to enlarge their ideas, or mend their
   national character.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">About</span> the year 425, the Romans, on account of domeſtic commotions, entirely
   forſook Britain, finding it impoſſible to defend ſo diſtant a frontier, The Picts and Scots,
   ſeizing this favourable opportunity, made incurſions into the deſerted province. The Britons,

    the ſlavery of ſeveral centuries, and thoſe vices, which are
   inſeparable from an advanced ſtate of civility, were not able to withſtand the impetuous, though
   irregular attacks of a barbarous enemy. In the utmoſt diſtreſs, they applied to their old
   maſters, the Romans, and (after the unfortunate ſtate of the Empire could not ſpare aid) to the
   Saxons, a nation equally barbarous and brave, with the enemies of whom they were ſo much afraid.
   Though the bravery of the Saxons repelled the Caledonian nations for a time, yet the latter found
   means to extend themſelves, conſiderably, towards the ſouth. It is, in this period, we muſt place
   the origin of the arts of Civil life among the Scots. The ſeat of government was removed from the
   mountains to the plain and more fertile provinces of the South, to be near the common enemy, in
   caſe of ſudden incurſions. Inſtead of roving through unfrequented wilds, in ſearch of
   ſubſiſtance, by means of hunting, men applied to agriculture, and raiſing of corn. This manner of
   life was the firſt means of changing the national character. The next thing which contributed to
   it was their mixture with ſtrangers.</p>

    incorporating with the conquerors, taught them
   agriculture, and other arts, which they themſelves had received from the Romans. The Scots,
   however, in number as well as power, being the moſt predominant, retained ſtill their language,
   and as many of the cuſtoms of their anceſtors, as ſuited with the nature of the country they
   poſſeſſed. Even the union of the two Caledonian kingdoms did not much affect the national
   character. Being originally deſcended from the ſame ſtock, the manners of the Picts and Scots
   were as ſimilar as the different natures of the countries they poſſefſed permitted.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">What</span> brought about a total change in the genius of the Scots nation, was
   their wars, and other tranſactions with the Saxons. Several counties in the ſouth of Scotland
   were alternately poſſeſſed by the two nations. They were ceded, in the ninth age, to the Scots,
   and, it is probable, that moſt of the Saxon inhabitants remained in poſſeſſion of their lands.
   During the ſeveral conqueſts and revolutions in England, many fled, for refuge, into Scotland, to
   avoid the oppreſſion of foreigners, or the tyranny of domeſtic uſurpers ; in ſo much, that the
   Saxon race formed perhaps near one half of the Scottiſh kingdom. The Saxon manners and language

   entirely relegated to inhabitants of the mountains, who were ſtill unmixed with ſtrangers.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">It</span> was after the acceſſion of territory which the Scots received, upon the
   retreat of the Romans from Britain, that the inhabitants of the Highlands were divided into
   clans. The king, when he kept his court in the mountains, was conſidered, by the whole nation, as
   the chief of their blood. Their ſmall number, as well as the preſence of their prince, prevented
   thoſe diviſions, which, afterwards, ſprung forth into ſo many ſeparate tribes. When the ſeat of
   government was removed to the ſouth, thoſe who remained in the Highlands were, of courſe,
   neglected. They naturally formed themſelves into ſmall ſocieties, independent of one another.
   Each ſociety had its own <i>regulus</i>, who either was, or in the ſucceſſion of a few
   generations, was regarded as chief of their blood. The nature of the country favoured an
   inſtitution of this ſort. A few valleys, divided from one another by extenſive heaths and
   impaſſible mountains, form the face of the Highlands. In theſe valleys the chiefs fixed their
   reſidence. Round them, and almoſt within ſight of their dwellings, were the habitations of their
   relations and dependents.</p>

    <span class="sc">The</span> ſeats of the Highland chiefs
   were neither diſagreeable nor inconvenient. Surrounded with mountains and hanging woods, they
   were covered from the inclemency of the weather. Near them generally ran a pretty large river,
   which, diſcharging itſelf not far off, into an arm of the ſea, or extenſive lake, ſwarmed with
   variety of fiſh. The woods were ſtocked with wild-fowl ; and the heaths and mountains behind them
   were the natural ſeat of the red-deer and roe. If we make allowance for the backward ſtate of
   agriculture, the valleys were not unfertile ; affording, if not all the conveniencies, at leaſt
   the neceſſaries of life. Here the chief lived, the ſupreme judge and law-giver of his own people
   ; but his ſway was neither ſevere nor unjuſt. As the populace regarded him as the chief of their
   blood, ſo he, in return, conſidered them as members of his family. His commands therefore, though
   abſolute and decifive, partook more of the authority of a father, than of the rigor of a judge.
   Though the whole territory of the tribe was conſidered as the property of the chief, yet his
   vaſſals made him no other conſideration for their lands than ſervices, neither burdenſome nor
   frequent. As he ſeldom went from home, he was at no expense. His table

    was ſupplied by his own herds, and what his numerous attendants
   killed in hunting.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> this rural kind of magnificence, the Highland chiefs lived, for many
   ages. At a diſtance from the ſeat of government, and ſecured, by the inacceſſibleneſs of their
   country, they were free and independent. As they had little communication with ſtrangers, the
   cuſtoms of their anceſtors remained among them, and their language retained its original purity.
   Naturally fond of military fame, and remarkably attached to the memory of their anceſtors, they
   delighted in traditions and ſongs, concerning the exploits of their nation, and eſpecially of
   their own particular families. A ſucceſſion of bards was retained in every clan, to hand down the
   memorable actions of their forefathers. As Fingal and his chiefs were the moſt renowned names in
   tradition, the bards took care to place them in the genealogy of every great family. They became
   famous among the people, and an object of fiction and poetry to the bards.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> bards erected their immediate patrons into heroes, and celebrated them

    language; their obſcurity and inaccuracy would diſguſt
   in a tranſlation. It was chiefly for this reaſon, that I have rejected wholly the works of the
   bards in my publications. Oſſian acted in a more extenſive ſphere, and his ideas ought to be more
   noble and univerſal ; neither gives he, I preſume, ſo many of thoſe peculiarities, which are only
   underſtood in a certain period or country. The other bards have their beauties, but not in this
   ſpecies of compoſition. Their rhimes, only calculated to kindle a martial ſpirit among the
   vulgar, afford very little pleaſure to genuine taſte. This obſervation only regards their poems
   of the heroic kind; in every inferior ſpecies of poetry they are more ſucceſsful. They expreſs
   the tender melancholy of deſponding love, with ſimplicity and nature. So well adapted are the
   ſounds of the words to the ſentiments, that, even without any knowledge of the language they
   pierce and diſſolve the heart. Succeſsful love is expreſſed with peculiar tenderneſs and
   elegance. In all their compoſitions, except the heroic, which was ſolely calculated to animate
   the vulgar, they give us the genuine language of the heart, without any of thoſe affected
   ornaments of phraſeology, which, tho' intended to beautify ſentiments, diveſt them of their
   natural force. The ideas, it is confeſſed,

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">It</span> was the locality of their deſcription and ſentiment, that, probably, has
   kept them hitherto in the obſcurity of an almoſt loſt language. The ideas of an unpoliſhed period
   are ſo contrary to the preſent advanced ſtate of ſociety, that more than a common mediocrity of
   taſte is required, to reliſh them as they deſerve. Thoſe who alone are capable of transferring

    ſubject and cataſtrophe of the poem are founded upon
   facts, which regarded the firſt peopling of that country, and the conteſts between the two
   Britiſh nations, who originally inhabited that iſland. In a preceding part of this Diſſertation,
   I have ſhewn how ſuperior the probability of this ſyſtem is to the undigeſted fictions of the
   Iriſh bards, and the more recent and regular legends of both Iriſh and Scottiſh hiſtorians. I
   mean not to give offence to the abettors of the high antiquities of the two nations, though I
   have all along expreſſed my doubts, concerning the veracity and abilities of thoſe who deliver
   down their antient hiſtory. For my own part, I prefer the national fame, ariſing from a few
   certain facts, to the legendary and uncertain annals of ages of remote and obſcure antiquity. No
   kingdom now eſtabliſhed in Europe can pretend to equal antiquity with that of the Scots,
   inconſiderable as it may appear in other reſpects, even according to my ſyſtem, ſo that it is

   Without vanity I ſay it, I think I could write tolerable poetry ; and I aſſure my antagoniſts,
   that I ſhould not tranſlate what I could not imitate.</p>
  <p class="noindent">As prejudice is the effect of ignorance, I am not ſurprized at its being general. An age that
   produces few marks of genius ought to be ſparing of admiration. The truth is, the bulk of mankind
   have ever been led, by reputation more than taſte, in articles of literature. If all the Romans,
   who admired Virgil, underſtood his beauties, he would have ſcarce deſerved to have come down to

    once, [ ſhall examine the ſubject, without further
   animadverſion on the blunder.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Of</span> all the nations deſcended from the antient <i>Celtæ</i>, the Scots and
   Iriſh are the moſt ſimilar in language, cuſtoms, and manners. This argues a more intimate
   connection between them, than a remote deſcent from the great Celtic ſtock. It is evident, in
   ſhort, that at ſome one period or other, they formed one ſociety, were ſubject to the ſame
   government, and were, in all reſpects, one and the ſame people. How they became divided, which
   the colony, or which the mother nation, I have in another work amply diſcuſſed. The firft
   circumſtance that induced me to diſregard the vulgarly-received opinion of the Hibernian
   extraction of the Scottiſh nation, was my obſervations on their antient language. That dialect of
   the Celtic tongue, ſpoken in the north of Scotland, is much more pure, more agreeable to its
   mother language, and more abounding with primitives, than that now ſpoken, or even that which has
   been written for ſome centuries back, amongſt the moſt unmixed part of the Iriſh nation. A
   Scotchman, tolerably converſant in his own language, underſtands an Iriſh compoſition, from that
   derivative analogy which it has to the <i>Galic</i> of North Britain. An Iriſhman, on the other
   hand, without the aid of ſtudy, can never underſtand

    a compoſition in the Galic tongue. This affords a proof, that the
   Scotch Galic is the moſt original, and, conſequently, the language of a more ancient and unmixed
   people. The Iriſh, however backward they may be to allow any thing to the prejudice of their
   antiquity, ſeem inadvertently to acknowledge it, by the very appellation they give to the dialect
   they ſpeak. They call their own language <i>Caëlic, Eirinach</i>, i. e. <i>Caledonian
   Iriſh</i>, when, on the contrary, they call the dialect of North-Britain <i>a Chaëlic</i>, or
   the <i>Caledonian tongue</i>, emphatically. A circumftance of this nature tends more to decide
   which is the moſt antient nation, than the united teſtimonies of a whole legion of ignorant bards
   and ſenachies, who, perhaps, never dreamed of bringing the Scots from Spain to Ireland, till ſome

    of that country, which were forming for ages, and
   growing as they came down, on the hands of ſucceſſive <i>ſenachies</i> and <i>fileas</i>, are
   found, at laſt, to be the ſpurious brood of modern and ignorant ages. To thoſe who know how
   tenacious the Iriſh are, of their pretended <i>Iberian</i> deſcent, this alone is proof
   ſufficient, that poems, ſo ſubverſive of their ſyſtem, could never be produced by an Hibernian
   bard. But when we look to the language, it is ſo different from the Iriſh dialect, that it would
   be as ridiculous to think, that Milton's Paradiſe Loſt could be wrote by a Scottiſh peaſant, as
   to ſuppoſe, that the poems aſcribed to Oſſian were writ in Ireland.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> pretenſions of Ireland to Oſſian proceed from another quarter. There are
   handed down, in that country, traditional poems, concerning the <i>Fiona</i>, or the heroes of
   <i>Fion Mac Comnal</i>. This <i>Fion</i>, ſay the Iriſh annaliſts, was general of the militia
   of Ireland, in the reign of Cormac, in the third century. Where Keating and O'Flaherty learned,
   that Ireland had an <i>embodied</i> militia ſo early, is not eaſy for me to determine. Their
   information certainly did not come from the Iriſh poems,concerning Fion. I have juſt now, in my

    compoſitions; but, unluckily for the antiquities of Ireland, they
   appear to be the work of a very modern period. Every ſtanza, nay almoſt every line, affords
   ſtriking proofs, that they cannot be three centuries old. Their alluſions to the manners and
   cuſtoms of the fifteenth century, are ſo many, that it is matter of wonder to me, how any one
   could dream of their antiquity. They are entirely writ in that romantic taſte, which prevailed
   two ages ago. Giants, enchanted caſtles, dwarfs, palfreys, witches and magicians form the whole
   circle of the poet's invention. The celebrated <i>Fion</i> could ſcarcely move from one hillock
   to another, without encountering a giant, or being entangled in the circles of a magician.
   Witches, on broomſticks, were continually hovering round him, like crows; and he had freed
   enchanted virgins in every valley in Ireland. In ſhort, <i>Fion</i>, great as he was, paſſed a
   diſagreeable life. Not only had he to engage all the miſchiefs in his own country, foreign armies
   invaded him, aſſiſted by magicians and witches, and headed by Kings, as tall as the main-maſt of
   a firſt rate. It muſt be owned, however, that <i>Fion</i> was not inferior to them in height.

    of Fingal in the year 286, yet his ſon Oſſian is made cotemporary
   with St. Patrick, who preached the goſpel in Ireland about the middle of the fifth age. Oſſian,
   though, at that time, he muſt have been two hundred and fifty years of age, had a daughter young
   enough to become wife to the ſaint. On account of this family connection, <i>Patrick of the
   Pſalms</i>, for ſo the apoſtle of Ireland is emphatically called in the poems, took great
   delight in the company of Oſſian, and in hearing the great actions of his family. The ſaint
   ſometimes threw off the aufterity of his profeſſion, drunk freely, and had his ſoul properly
   warmed with wine, to receive with becoming enthuſiaſm, the poems of his father-in-law. One of the
   poems begins with this piece of uſeful information, <span class="quote">

    the <i>Iriſh Oſſian</i> diſcovers the age in which
   he lived, by an unlucky anachroniſm. After deſcribing the total route of Erragon, he very gravely
   concludes with this remarkable anecdote, that none of the foe eſcaped, but a few, who were
   permitted to go on a pilgrimage to the <i>Holy Land</i>. This circumſtance fixes the date of
   the compofition of the piece ſome centuries after the famous croiſade; for, it is evident, that
   the poet thought the time of the croiſade ſo ancient, that he confounds it with the age of
   Fingal. Erragon, in the courſe of this poem, is often called, <span class="quote">
   Riogh <i>Lochlin</i> an do ſhloigh,
    <i>King of Denmark of two nations</i> </span> which alludes to the union of the
   kingdoms of Norway and Denmark, a circumſtance which happened under Margaret de Waldemar, in the
   cloſe of the fourteenth age. Modern, however, as this pretended Oſſian was, it is certain, he
   lived before the Iriſh had dreamed of appropriating <i>Fion</i>, or <i>Fingal</i>, to
   themſelves. He concludes the poem, with this reflection.<span class="quote">

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> next poem that falls under our obſervation is <i>Cath-cabhra</i>, or,
   <i>The death of Oſcar</i>. This piece is founded on the ſame ſtory which we have in the firft
   book of Temora. So little thought the author of Cath-cabhra of making Oſcar his countryman, that,
   in the courſe of two hundred lines, of which the poems conſiſts, he puts the following expreſſion
   thrice in the mouth of the hero :
  <span class="quote">

  <p class="noindent">“It is the fleet of my grandfather, coming with aid to our field, from <span class="sc">Albion</span> of many waves !” —The teſtimony of this bard is ſufficient to confute the idle
   fictions of Keating and O'Flaherty ; for, though he is far from being ancient, it is probable, he
   flouriſhed a full century before theſe hiſtorians. He appears, however, to have been a much
   better chriſtian than chronologer; for <i>Fion</i>, though he is placed two centuries before
   St. Patrick, very devoutly recommends the ſoul of his grandſon to his Redeemer.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><i>Duan a Gharibh Mac-Starn</i> is another Iriſh poem in high repute. The grandeur of its

   ignorance of etymology. <span class="sc">Cu</span>, <i>voice</i>, or commander, ſignifies alſo a

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſubject of the poem is the ſame with that of the epic poem of Fingal.
   <i>Caribh Mac-Starn</i> is the ſame with Oſſian's Swaran, the ſon of Starno. His ſingle combats
   with, and his victory over all the heroes of Ireland, excepting the <i>celebrated dog of
   Tara</i>, i. e. Cuthullin, afford matter for two hundred lines of tolerable poetry.
   <i>Caribh</i>'s progreſs in ſearch of Cuthullin, and his intrigue with the gigantic
   Emir-bragal, that hero's wife, enables the poet to extend his piece to four hundred lines. This
   author, it is true, makes Cuthullin a native of Ireland ; the gigantic Emir-bragal he calls the
   <i>guiding ſtar of the women of Ireland</i>. The property of this enormous lady I ſhall not
   diſpute with him, or any other. But, as he ſpeaks with great tenderneſs of the <i>daughters of
   the convent</i>, and throws out ſome hints againſt the Engliſh nation, it is probable he lived
   in too modern a period to be intimately acquainted with the genealogy of Cuthullin.

   Little can be ſaid for the judgment of this poet, and leſs for his delicacy of ſentiment. The
   hiſtory of one of his epiſodes may, at once, ſtand as a ſpecimen of his want of both. Ireland, in
   the days of <i>Fion</i>, happened to be threatened with an invaſion, by three great potentates,
   the kings of Lochlin, Sweden, and France. lt is needleſs to inſiſt upon the impropriety of a
   French invaſion of Ireland ; it is ſufficient for me to be faithful to the language of my author.
   <i>Fion</i>, upon receiving intelligence of the intended invaſion, ſent Ca-olt, Oſſian, and
   Oſcar, to watch the bay, in which, it was apprehended, the enemy was to land. Oſcar was the worſt
   choice of a ſcout that could be made, for, brave as he was, he had the bad property of falling
   very often aſleep on his poſt, nor was it poſſible to awake him, without cutting off one of his
   fingers, or daſhing a large ſtone againſt his head. When the enemy appeared, Oſcar, very
   unfortunately, was aſleep. Oſſian and Ca-olt conſulted about the method of wakening him, and

   ages, were often in open war, and never in cordial friendſhip with the Engliſh. The ſimilarity of
   manners and language, the traditions concerning their common origin, and above all, their having
   to do with the ſame enemy, created a free and friendly intercourſe between the Scottiſh and Iriſh
   nations. As the cuſtom of retaining bards and ſenachies was common to both ; ſo each, no doubt,

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> Saxon manners and language had, at that time, made great progreſs in the

   Britain. At this time, certainly, was eſtabliſhed that Hibernian ſyſtem of the original of the
   Scots, which afterwards, for want of any other, was univerſally received. The Scots of the
   low-country, who, by lofing the language of their anceſtors, loſt, together with it, their

   Scots, have been handed down without interruption. Tho' a few ignorant ſenachies might be
   perſuaded out of their own opinion, by the ſmoothneſs of an Iriſh tale, it was impoſſible to

   bards of Ireland have diſplayed a genius for poetry. It was, alone, in matters of antiquity, that
   they were monſtrous in their fables. Their love-ſonnets, and their elegies on the death of
   perſons worthy or renowned, abound with ſimplicity, and a wild harmony of numbers. They become
   more than an atonement for their errors, in every other ſpecies of poetry. But the beauty of

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Among</span> the monuments remaining of the ancient ſtate of nations, few are more
   valuable than their poems or ſongs. Hiſtory, when it treats of remote or dark ages, is ſeldom
   very inſtructive. The beginnings of ſociety, in every country, are involved in fabulous
   confuſion; and though they were not, they would furniſh few events worth recording. But, in every
   period of ſociety, human manners are a curious ſpectacle; and the moſt natural pictures of
   ancient manners are exhibited in the ancient poems of nations. Theſe preſent to us what is much

They make
   us acquainted with the notions and feelings of our fellow creatures in the moſt artleſs ages;
   Diſcovering what objects they admired, and what pleaſures they purſued, before thoſe refinements
   of ſociety had taken place, which enlarge, indeed, and diverſify the tranſactions, but diſguiſe
   the manners of mankind. </p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Beſides</span> this merit which ancient poems have with philoſophical obſervers of
   human nature, they have another with perſons of taſte. They promiſe ſome of the higheſt beauties
   of poetical writing. Irregular and unpoliſhed we may expect the production of uncultivated ages
   to be; but abounding, at the ſame time, with that enthuſiaſm, that vehemence and fire, which are
   the ſoul of poetry: for many circumſtances of thoſe times which we call barbarous, are favourable
   to the poetical ſpirit. That ſtate, in which human nature ſhoots wild and free, though unfit for
   other improvements, certainly encourages the high exertions of fancy and paſſion.</p>

   the ſudden changes of fortune occurring in their unſettled ſtate of life, their paſſions are
   raiſed to the utmoſt; their paſſions have nothing to reſtrain them, their imagination has nothing
   to check it. They diſplay themſelves to one another without diſguiſe, and converſe and act in the
   uncovered ſimplicity of nature. As their feelings are ſtrong, ſo their language, of itſelf,
   aſſumes a poetical turn. Prone to exaggerate, they deſcribe everything in the ſtrongeſt colours;
   which of courſe renders their ſpeech pictureſque and figurative. Figurative language owes its
   riſe chiefly to two cauſes; to the want of proper names for objects, and to the influence of
   imagination and paſſion over the form of expreſſion. Both theſe cauſes concur in the infancy of
   ſociety. Figures are commonly conſidered as artificial modes of ſpeech, deviſed by orators and
   poets, after the world had advanced to a refined ſtate. The contrary of this is the truth. Men
   never have uſed ſo many figures of ſtyle as in thoſe rude ages, when, beſides the power of a warm
   imagination to ſuggeſt lively images, the want of proper and preciſe terms for the ideas they
   would expreſs, obliged them to have recourſe to circumlocution, metaphor, compariſon, and all
   thoſe ſubſtituted forms of expreſſion, which give a poetical air to language.

   more favourable to accuracy than to ſprightlineſs and ſublimity. As the world advances, the
   underſtanding gains ground upon the imagination; the underſtanding is more exerciſed; the
   imagination, leſs. Fewer objects occur that are new or ſurpriſing. Men apply themſelves to trace
   the cauſes of things; they correct and refine one another; they ſubdue or diſguiſe their
   paſſions; they form their exterior manners upon one uniform ſtandard of politeneſs and civility.
   Human nature is pruned according to method and rule. Language advances from ſterility to
   copiouſneſs, and at the ſame time from fervor and enthuſiaſm, to correctneſs and preciſion. Style
   becomes more chaſte, but leſs animated. The progreſs of the world in this reſpect reſembles the
   progreſs of age in man. The powers of imagination are moſt vigorous and predominant in youth;

   of ſociety As the ideas of our youth are remembered with a peculiar pleaſure, on account of their
   livelineſs and vivacity, ſo the moſt ancient poems have often proved the greateſt favourites of
   nations.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Poetry</span> has been ſaid to be more ancient than proſe; and, however paradoxical
   ſuch an aſſertion may ſeem, yet, in a qualified ſenſe, it is true. Men certainly never converſed
   with one another in regular numbers; but even their ordinary language would, in ancient times,
   for the reaſons before aſſigned, approach to a poetical ſtyle; and the firſt compoſitions
   tranſmitted to poſterity, beyond doubt, were, in a literal ſenſe, poems; that is, compoſitions in
   which imagination had the chief hand, formed into ſome kind of numbers, and pronounced with a
   muſical modulation or tone. Muſic or ſong has been found coeval with ſociety among the moſt
   barbarous nations. The only ſubjects which could prompt men, in their firſt rude ſtate, to utter
   their thoughts in compoſitions of any length, were ſuch as naturally aſſumed the tone of poetry;
   praiſes of their gods, or of their anceſtors; commemorations of their own warlike exploits, or
   lamentations over their miſfortunes.

   compoſitions, except ſongs or poems, could take ſuch hold of the imagination and memory, as to be
   preſerved by oral tradition, and handed down from one race to another.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Hence</span> we may expect to find poems among the antiquities of all nations. It
   is probable, too, that an extenſive ſearch would diſcover a certain degree of reſemblance among
   all the moſt ancient poetical productions, from whatever country they have proceeded. In a
   ſimilar ſtate of manners, ſimilar objects and paſſions, operating upon the imaginations of men,
   will ſtamp their productions with the ſame general character. Some diverſity will, no doubt, be
   occaſioned by climate and genius. But mankind never bear ſuch reſembling features as they do in
   the beginnings of ſociety. Its ſubſequent revolutions give riſe to the principal diſtinctions
   among nations; and divert, into channels widely ſeparated, that current of human genius and
   manners which deſcends originally from one ſpring. What we have been long accuſtomed to call the

   tranſlated by Olaus, word for word, from the original. This Lodbrog was a king of Denmark, who
   lived in the eighth century, famous for his wars and victories; and at the ſame time an eminent
   <i>ſcalder</i>, or poet. It was his miſfortune to fall at laſt into the hands of one of his
   enemies, by whom he was thrown into priſon, and condemned to he deſtroyed by ſerpents. In this
   ſituation he ſolaced himſelf with rehearſing all the exploits of his life. The poem is divided
   into twenty-nine ſtanzas, of ten lines each; and every ſtanza begins with theſe words,
   “Pugnavimus enſibus,” We have fought with our ſwords. Olauſ's verſion is in many places ſo
   obſcure as to be hardly intelligible. I have ſubjoined the whole below, exactly as he has

The crows around the Indirian iſlands
   had an ample prey. It were difficult to ſingle out one among ſo many deaths. At the riſing of the
   ſun I beheld the ſpears piercing the bodies of foes, and the bows throwing forth their
   ſteel-pointed arrows. Loud roared the ſwords in the plains of Lano.—The virgin long bewailed the
   ſlaughter of that morning.”—In this ſtrain the poet continues to deſcribe ſeveral other military
   exploits. The images are not much varied: the noiſe of arms, the ſtreaming of blood, and the
   feaſting the birds of prey often recurring. He mentions the death of two of his ſons in battle;
   and the lamentation he deſcribes as made for one of them is very ſingular. A Grecian or a Roman
   poet would have introduced the virgins or nymphs of the wood bewailing the untimely fall of a
   young hero. But, ſays our Gothic poet, “When Rogvaldus was ſlain, for him mourned all the hawks
   of heaven,” as lamenting a benefactor who had ſo liberally ſupplied them with prey; “for boldly,”
   as he adds, “in the ſtrife of ſwords did the breaker of helmets throw the ſpear of blood.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> poem concludes with ſentiments of the higheſt bravery and contempt of

   always ready to oppoſe it? He only regrets this life who hath never known diſtreſs. The timorous
   man allures the, devouring eagle to the field of battle. The coward, wherever he comes, is
   uſeleſs to himſelf. This I eſteem honourable, that the youth ſhould advance to the combat fairly
   matched one againſt another; nor man retreat from man. Long was this the warrior's higheſt glory.
   He who aſpires to the love of virgins, ought always to be foremoſt in the roar of arms. It
   appears to me, of truth, that we are led by the Fates. Seldom can any overcome the appointment of
   deſtiny. Little did I foreſee that Ella <a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333998720"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a> was to have my life
   in his hands, in that day when fainting I concealed my blood, and puſhed forth my ſhips into the
   waves; after we had ſpread a repaſt for the beaſts of prey throughout the Scottiſh bays. But this
   makes me always rejoice, that in the halls of our father Balder [or Odin] I know there are ſeats

How
   eagerly would all the ſons of Aſlauga now ruſh to war, did they know the diſtreſs of their
   father, whom a multitude of venomous ſerpents tear! I have given to my children a mother who hath
   filled their hearts with valor. I am faſt approaching to my end. A cruel death awaits me from the
   viper's bite. A ſnake dwells in the midſt of my heart. I hope that the ſword of ſome of my ſons
   ſhall yet be ſtained with the blood of Ella. The valiant youths will wax red with anger, and will
   not ſit in peace. Fifty and one times have I reared the ſtandard in battle. In my youth I learned
   to dye the ſword in blood: my hope was then that no king among men would be more renowned than
   me. The goddeſſes of death will now ſoon call me; I muſt not mourn my death. Now I end my ſong.
   The goddeſſes invite me away; they whom Odin has ſent to me from his hall. I will ſit upon a
   lofty ſeat, and drink ale joyfully with the goddeſſes of death. The hours of my life are run out.
   I will ſmile when I die.”</p>

   we learn from ſome of Olauſ's notes, highly metaphorical and figured.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> when we open the works of Oſſian, a very different ſcene preſents
   itſelf. There we find the fire and enthuſiaſm of the moſt early times, combined with an amazing,
   degree of regularity and art. We find tenderneſs, and even delicacy of ſentiment, greatly
   predominant over fierceneſs and barbarity. Our hearts are melted with the ſofteſt feelings, and
   at the ſame time elevated with the higheſt ideas of magnanimity, generoſity, and true heroiſm.
   When we turn from the poetry of Lodbrog to that of Oſſian, it is like paſſing from a ſavage
   deſert into a fertile and cultivated country. How is this to be accounted for? or by what means
   to be reconciled with the remote antiquity attributed to theſe poems? This is a curious point,
   and requires to be illuſtrated.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">That</span> the ancient Scots were of Celtic original, is paſt all doubt. Their

   Celtæ or Gauls are mentioned by ancient writers, we ſeldom fall to hear of their Druids and their
   Bards; the inſtitution of which two orders was the capital diſtinction of their manners and
   policy. The druids were their philoſophers and prieſts; the bards their poets and recorders of
   heroic actions; and, both theſe orders of men ſeem to have ſubſiſted among them, as chief members

   altogether a groſs and rude nation. They poſſeſſed from very remote ages a formed ſyſtem of
   diſcipline and manners, which appears to have had a deep and laſting influence. Ammianus
   Marcellinus gives them this expreſs teſtimony, that there flouriſhed among them the ſtudy of the
   moſt laudable arts, introduced by the bards, whoſe office it was to ſing in heroic verſe the

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">So</span> ſtrong was the attachment of the Celtic nations to their poetry and
   bards, that, amidſt all the changes of their government and manners, even long after the order of
   the druids was extinct, and the national religion altered, the bards continued to flouriſh; not
   as a ſet of ſtrolling ſongſters, like the Greek Αοιδοι, or Rhapſodiſts, in Homer's time, but as
   an order of men highly reſpected in the ſtate, and ſupported by a public eſtabliſhment. We find
   them, according to the teſtimonies of Strabo and Diodorus, before the age of Auguſtus Cæſar; and
   we find them remaining under the ſame name, and exerciſing the ſame functions as of old, in
   Ireland, and in the north of Scotland, almoſt down to our own times. It is well known, that in
   both theſe countries every <i>Regulus</i> or chief had his own bard, who was conſidered as an
   officer of rank in his court; and had lands aſſigned him, which deſcended to his family. Of the
   honour in which the bards were held, many inſtances occur in Oſſian's Poems. On all important

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">From</span> all this, the Celtic tribes clearly appear to have been addicted in ſo
   high a degree to poetry, and to have made it ſo much their ſtudy from the earlieſt times, as may
   remove our wonder at meeting with a vein of higher poetical refinement among them, than was at
   firſt to have been expected among nations whom we are accuſtomed to call barbarous. Barbarity, I
   muſt obſerve, is a very equivocal term; it admits of many different forms and degrees; and
   though, in all of them, it excludes poliſhed manners, it is, however, not inconſiſtent with
   generous ſentiments and tender affections. <a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333967488"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>

   throughout a long ſeries of ages, had their imaginations continually employed on the ideas of
   heroiſm; who had all the poems and panegyrics, which were compoſed by their predeceſſors, handed
   down to them with care; who rivalled and endeavored to outſtrip thoſe who had gone before them,
   each in the celebration of his particular hero; is it not natural to think, that at length the
   character of a hero would appear in their ſongs with the higheſt luſtre, and be adorned with
   qualities truly noble? Some of the qualities indeed which diſtinguiſh a Fingal, moderation,
   humanity, and clemency, would not probably be the firſt ideas of heroiſm occurring to a barbarous
   people: but no ſooner had ſuch ideas begun to dawn on the minds of poets, than, as the human mind
   eaſily opens to the native repreſentations of human perfection, they would be ſeized and

   to exalt the public manners. For ſuch ſongs as theſe, familiar to the Celtic warriors from their
   childhood, and, throughout their whole life, both in war and in peace, their principal
   entertainment, muſt have had a very conſiderable influence in propagating among them real
   manners, nearly approaching to the poetical; and in forming even ſuch a hero as Fingal.
   Eſpecially when we conſider, that among their limited objects of ambition, among the few
   advantages which, in a ſavage ſtate, man could obtain over man, the chief was fame, and that
   immortality which they expected to receive from their virtues and exploits, in ſongs of
   bards<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333952496"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Having</span> made theſe remarks on the Celtic poetry and bards in general, I ſhall
   next conſider the particular advantages which Oſſian poſſeſſed. He appears clearly to have lived

In
   one remarkable paſſage Oſſian deſcribes himſelf as living in a ſort of claſſical age, enlightened
   by the memorials of former times, which were conveyed in the ſongs of bards; and points at a
   period of darkneſs and ignorance which lay beyond the reach of tradition. “His words,” ſays he,
   “Came only by halves to our ears; they were dark as the tales of other times, before the light of
   the ſong aroſe.” Oſſian himſelf appears to have been endowed by nature with an exquiſite
   ſenſibility of heart; prone to that tender melancholy which is ſo often an attendant on great
   genius: and ſuſceptible equally of ſtrong and of ſoft emotion. He was not only a profeſſed bard,
   educated with care, as we may eaſily believe, to all the poetical art then known, and connected,
   as he ſhews us himſelf, in intimate friendſhip with the other contemporary bards, but a warrior
   alſo; and the ſon of the moſt renowned hero and prince of his age. This formed a conjunction of
   circumſtances uncommonly favourable towards exalting the imagination of a poet. He relates
   expeditions in which he had been engaged; he ſings of battles in which he had fought and
   overcome; he had beheld the moſt illuſtrious ſcenes which that age could exhibit, both of heroiſm

For however
   rude the magnificence of thoſe times may ſeem to us, we muſt remember, that all ideas of
   magnificence are comparative; and that the age of Fingal was an æra of diſtinguiſhed ſplendor in
   that part of the world. Fingal reigned over a conſiderable territory; he was enriched with the
   ſpoils of the Roman province; he was ennobled by his victories and great actions; and was in all
   reſpects a perſonage of much higher dignity than any of the chieftains, or heads of clans, who
   lived in the ſame country, after a more extenſive monarchy was eſtabliſhed,</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> manners of Oſſian's age, ſo far as we can gather them from his writings,
   were abundantly favourable to a poetical genius. The two diſpiriting vices, to which Longinus
   imputes the decline of poetry, covetouſneſs and effeminacy, were as yet unknown. The cares of men
   were few. They lived a roving indolent life; hunting and war their principal employments; and
   their chief amuſements, the muſic of bards, and the feaſt of ſhells.” The great objects purſued
   by heroic ſpirits, was “to receive their fame;” that is, to become worthy of being celebrated in
   the ſongs of bards; and “to have their name on the four gray ſtones.” To die unlamented by a
   bard, was deemed ſo great a miſfortune as

   ſtate. They wander in thick miſts beſide the reedy lake but never ſhall they riſe, without the
   ſong, to the dwelling of winds.” After death, they expected to follow employments of the ſame
   nature with thoſe which had amuſed them on earth; to fly with their friends on clouds, to purſue
   airy deer, and to liſten to their praiſe in the mouths of bards. In ſuch times as theſe, in a
   country where poetry had been ſo long cultivated, and ſo highly honoured, is it any wonder that,
   among the race and ſucceſſion of bards, one Homer ſhould ariſe: a man, who, endowed with a
   natural happy genius, favoured with peculiar advantages of birth and condition, and meeting, in
   the courſe of his life, with a variety of incidents proper to fire his imagination, and to touch
   his heart, ſhould attain a degree of eminence in poetry, worthy to draw the admiration of more
   refined ages?</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> compoſitions of Oſſian are ſo ſtrongly marked with characters of
   antiquity, that although there were no external proof to ſupport that antiquity, hardly any
   reader of judgment and taſte could heſitate in referring them to a very remote æra. There are
   four great ſtages through which men ſucceſſively paſs in the progreſs of ſociety. The firſt and

   this, as the ideas of property begin to take root; next agriculture; and, laſtly, commerce.
   Throughout Oſſian's Poems we plainly find ourſelves in the firſt of theſe periods of ſociety;
   during which hunting was the chief employment of men, and the principal method of their procuring
   ſubſiſtence. Paſturage was not indeed wholly unknown; for we hear of dividing the herd in the
   caſe of a divorce; but the alluſions to herds and to cattle are not many; and of agriculture we
   find no traces. No cities appear to have been built in the territories of Fingal. No arts are
   mentioned, except that of navigation and of working in iron<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333935072"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>. Every thing preſents to

At
   their feaſts, the heroes prepared their own repaſt; they ſat round the light of the burning oak;
   the wind lifted their locks, and whiſtled through their open halls. Whatever was beyond the
   neceſſaries of life was known to them only as the ſpoil of the Roman province; “the gold of the
   ſtranger; the lights of the ſtranger; the ſteeds of the ſtranger; the children of the rein.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">This</span> repreſentation of Oſſian's times muſt ſtrike us the more, as genuine
   and authentick, when it is compared with a poem of later date, which Mr. Macpherſon has preſerved
   in one of his notes. It is that in which five bards are repreſented as paſſing the evening in the
   houſe of a chief, and each of them ſeparately giving his deſcription of the night. The night
   ſcenery is beautiful; and the author has plainly imitated the ſtyle and manner of Oſſian; but he
   has allowed ſome images to appear which betray a later period of ſociety. For we meet with

   ſeeking ſhelter, the ſhepherd wandering, corn on the plain, and the wakeful hind rebuilding the
   ſhocks of corn which had been overturned by the tempeſt. Whereas, in Oſſian's works, from
   beginning to end, all is conſiſtent; no modern alluſion drops from him; but everywhere the ſame
   face of rude nature appears; a country wholly uncultivated, thinly inhabited, and recently
   peopled. The graſs of the rock, the flower of the heath, the thiſtle with its beard, are the
   chief ornaments of his landſcapes. “The deſert,” ſays Fingal, “is enough for me, with all its
   woods and deer.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> circle of ideas and tranſactions is no wider than ſuits ſuch an age; nor
   any greater diverſity introduced into characters, than the events of that period would naturally
   diſplay. Valor and bodily ſtrength are the admired qualities. Contentions ariſe, as is uſual
   among ſavage nations, from the ſlighteſt cauſes. To be affronted at a tournament, or to be
   omitted in the invitation to a feaſt, kindles a war. Women are often carried away by force; and
   the whole tribe, as in the Homeric times, riſe to avenge the wrong. The heroes ſhow refinement of
   ſentiment indeed on ſeveral occaſions, but none of manners. They ſpeak of their paſt

   exploits, and ſing their own praiſe. In their battles, it is evident, that drums, trumpets, or
   bagpipes, were not known or uſed. They had no expedient for giving the military alarms but
   ſtriking a ſhield, or raiſing a loud cry: and hence the loud and terrible voice of Fingal is
   often mentioned as a neceſſary qualification of a great general; like the <i>βοην αγαθος Μενελαος</i> of Homer. Of military diſcipline or ſkill they appear to have
   been entirely deſtitute. Their armies ſeem not to have been numerous; their battles were
   diſorderly; and terminated, for the moſt part, by a perſonal combat, or wreſtling of the two
   chiefs; after which, “the bard ſung the ſong of peace, and the battle ceaſed along the
   field.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> manner of compoſition bears all the marks of the greateſt antiquity. No
   artful tranſitions, nor full and extended connexion of parts; ſuch as we find among the poets of
   later times, when order and regularity of compoſition were more ſtudied and known: but a ſtyle
   always rapid and vehement; narration conciſe, even to abruptneſs, and leaving ſeveral
   circumſtances to be ſupplied by the reader's imagination. The language has all that figurative
   caſt, which, as I before ſhowed, partly a glowing and

   ſterility of language and the want of proper terms, have always introduced into the early ſpeech
   of nations; and in ſeveral reſpects, it carries a remarkable reſemblance to the ſtyle of the Old
   Teſtament. It deſerves particular notice, as one of the moſt genuine and deciſive characters of
   antiquity, that very few general terms, or abſtract ideas, are to be met with in the whole
   collection of Oſſian's works. The ideas of men, at firſt, were all particular. They had not words
   to expreſs general conceptions. Theſe were the conſequences of more profound reflection, and
   longer acquaintance with the arts of thought and of ſpeech. Oſſian, accordingly, almoſt never
   expreſſes himſelf in the abſtract. His ideas extended little further than to the objects he ſaw
   around him. A public, a community, the univerſe, were conceptions beyond his ſphere. Even a
   mountain, a ſea, or a lake, which he has occaſion to mention, though only in a ſimile, are for
   the moſt part particularized; it is the hill of Cromla, the ſtorm of the ſea of Malmor, or the
   reeds of the lake of Lego. A mode of expreſſion which, while it is characteriſtical of ancient
   ages, is at the ſame time highly favourable to deſcriptive poetry. For the ſame reaſons,
   perſonification is a poetical figure not

Inanimate objects,
   ſuch as winds, trees, flowers, he ſometimes perſonifies with great beauty. But the
   perſonifications which are ſo familiar to later poets, of Fame, Time, Terror, Virtue, and the
   reſt of that claſs, were unknown to our Celtic bard. Theſe were modes of conception too abſtract
   for his age.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">All</span> theſe are marks ſo undoubted, and ſome of them, too ſo nice and
   delicate, of the moſt early times, as put the high antiquity of theſe poems out of queſtion.
   Eſpecially when we conſider, that if there had been any impoſture in this caſe, it muſt have been
   contrived and executed in the Highlands of Scotland, two or three centuries ago; as up to this
   period, both by manuſcripts, and by the teſtimony of a multitude of living witneſſes, concerning
   the uncontrovertible tradition of theſe poems, they can clearly be traced. Now, this is a period
   when that country enjoyed no advantages for a compoſition of this kind, which it may not be
   ſuppoſed to have enjoyed in as great, if not in a greater degree, a thouſand years before. To
   ſuppoſe that two or three hundred years ago, when we well know the Highlands to have been in a

   knowledge of mankind, and of hiſtory, as to diveſt himſelf of the ideas and manners of his own
   age, and to give us a juſt and natural picture of a ſtate of ſociety ancienter by a thouſand
   years; one who could ſupport this counterfeited antiquity through ſuch a large collection of
   poems, without the leaſt inconſiſtency; and who, poſſeſſed of all this genius and art, had, at
   the ſame time, the ſelf-denial of concealing himſelf, and of aſcribing his own works to an
   antiquated bard, without the impoſture being detected; is a ſuppoſition that tranſcends all
   bounds of credibility.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">There</span> are, beſides, two other circumſtances to be attended to, ſtill of
   greater weight, if poſſible, againſt this hypotheſis. One is, the total abſence of religious
   ideas from this work; for which the tranſlator has, in his preface, given a very probable
   account, on the footing of its being the work of Oſſian. The druidical ſuperſtition was, in the
   days of Oſſian, on the point of its final extinction; and, for particular reaſons, odious to the
   family of Fingal; whilſt the Chriſtian faith was not yet eſtabliſhed. But had it been the work of
   one to whom the ideas of Chriſtianity were familiar from his infancy, and who had ſuperadded to
   them alſo the

   country, it is impoſſible. but in ſome paſſage or other, the traces of them would have appeared.
   The other circumſtance is, the entire ſilence which reigns with reſpect to all the great clans or
   families which are now eſtabliſhed in the Highlands. The origin of theſe ſeveral clans is known
   to be very ancient; and it is well known that there is no paſſion by which a native Highlander is
   more diſtinguiſhed than by attachment to his clan, and jealouſy for its honour. That a Highland
   bard, in forging a work relating to the antiquities of his country, ſhould have inſerted no
   circumſtance which pointed out the riſe of his own clan, which aſcertained its antiquity, or
   increaſed its glory, is, of all ſuppoſitions that can be formed, the moſt improbable; and the
   ſilence on this head amounts to a demonſtration that the author lived before any of the preſent
   great clans were formed or known.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Aſſuming</span> it then, as well we may, for certainty, that the poems, now under
   conſideration, are genuine venerable monuments of a very remote antiquity, I proceed to make ſome
   remarks upon their general ſpirit and ſtrain. The two great characteriſtics of Oſſian's poetry

   Oſſian is, perhaps, the only poet who never relaxes, or lets himſelf down into the light and
   amuſing ſtrain which I readily admit to be no ſmall diſadvantage to him, with the bulk of
   readers. He moves perpetually in the high region of the grand and the pathetic. One keynote is
   ſtruck at the beginning, and ſupported to the end; nor is any ornament introduced, but what is
   perfectly concordant with the general tone of melody. The events recorded, are all ſerious and
   grave; the ſcenery throughout, wild and romantic. The extended heath by the ſeaſhore; the
   mountains ſhaded with miſt; the torrent ruſhing through a ſolitary valley; the ſcattered oaks,
   and the tombs of warriors overgrown with moſs; all produce a ſolemn attention in the mind, and
   prepare it for great and extraordinary events. We find not in Oſſian an imagination that ſports
   itſelf, and dreſſes out gay trifles to pleaſe the fancy. His poetry, more perhaps than that of
   any other writer, deſerves to be ſtiled, <i>The poetry of the heart</i>. It is a heart
   penetrated with noble ſentiments and with ſublime and tender paſſions; a heart that glows, and
   kindles the fancy; a heart that is full, and pours itſelf forth. Oſſian did not write,, like
   modern poets, to pleaſe readers and critics. He ſung from the

His delight was to
   think of the heroes among whom he had flouriſhed; to recall the affecting incidents of his life;
   to dwell upon his paſt wars, and loves, and friendſhips: till, as he expreſſes it himſelf, “there
   comes a voice to Oſſian, and awakes his ſoul. It is the voice of years that are gone; they roll
   before me with all their deeds;” and under this true poetic inſpiration, giving vent to his
   genius, no wonder we ſhould ſo often hear, and acknowledge, in his ſtrains, the powerful and
   ever-pleaſing voice of nature.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">It</span> is neceſſary here to obſerve, that the beauties of Oſſian's writings
   cannot be felt by thoſe who have given them only a ſingle or haſty peruſal. His manner is ſo
   different from that of the poets to whom we are moſt accuſtomed; his ſtyle is ſo conciſe, and ſo
   much crowned with imagery; the mind is kept at ſuch a ſtretch in accompanying the author; that an
   ordinary reader is at firſt apt to be dazzled and fatigued, rather than pleaſed. His poems
   require to he taken up at intervals, and to be frequently reviewed; and then it is impoſſible but

Thoſe who have the higheſt
   degree of it will reliſh them the moſt.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">As</span> Homer is, of all the great poets, the one whoſe manner, and whoſe times,
   come the neareſt to Oſſian's, we are naturally led to run a parallel in ſome inſtances between
   the Greek and Celtic bard. For though Homer lived more than a thouſand years before Oſſian, it is
   not from the age of the world, but from the ſtate of ſociety that we are to judge of reſembling
   times. The Greek has, in ſeveral points, a manifeſt ſuperiority. He introduces a greater variety
   of incidents; he poſſeſſes a larger compaſs of ideas; has more diverſity in his characters; and a
   much deeper knowledge of human nature. It was not to be expected, that in any of theſe
   particulars Oſſian could equal Homer. For Homer lived in a country where ſociety was much farther
   advanced; he had beheld many more objects; cities built and flouriſhing; laws inſtituted; order,
   diſcipline, and arts, begun. His field of obſervation was much larger and more ſplendid: his
   knowledge, of courſe, more extenſive; his mind alſo, it ſhall be granted, more penetrating. But
   if Oſſian's ideas and objects be leſs diverſified than thoſe of Homer, they are all, however, of
   the kind fitteſt for poetry: the bravery and generoſity of heroes, the tenderneſs of lovers,

   children. In a rude age and country, though the events that happen be few, the undiſſipated mind
   broods over them more; they ſtrike the imagination, and fire the paſſions, in a higher degree;
   and, of conſequence, become happier materials to a poetical genius, than the ſame events when
   ſcattered through the wide circle of more varied action and cultivated life.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Homer</span> is a more cheerful and ſprightly poet than Oſſian. You diſcern in him
   all the Greek vivacity; whereas Oſſian uniformly maintains the gravity and ſolemnity of a Celtic
   hero. This, too, is in a great meaſure to be accounted for from the different ſituations in which
   they lived—partly perſonal, and partly national. Oſſian had ſurvived all his friends, and was
   diſpoſed to melancholy by the incidents of his life. But, beſides this, cheerfulneſs is one of
   the many bleſſings which we owe to formed ſociety. The ſolitary, wild ſtate, is always a ſerious
   one. Bating the ſudden and violent burſts of mirth, which ſometimes break forth at their dances
   and feaſts, the ſavage American tribes have been noted by all travellers for their gravity and
   taciturnity. Somewhat of this taciturnity may be alſo be remarked in Oſſian. On all occaſions he
   is frugal of his words; and never gives you more of an

   ſufficient to place it before you in one clear point of view. It is a blaze of lightning, which
   flaſhes and vaniſhes. Homer is more extended in his deſcriptions, and fills them up with a
   greater variety of circumſtances. Both the poets are dramatic; that is, they introduce their
   perſonages frequently ſpeaking before us. But Oſſian is conciſe and rapid in his ſpeeches, as he
   is in every other thing. Homer, with the Greek vivacity, had alſo ſome portion of the Greek
   loquacity. His ſpeeches, indeed, are highly characteriſtical; and to them we are much indebted
   for that admirable diſplay he has given of human nature. Yet, if he be tedious any where, it is
   in theſe: ſome of them are trifling, and ſome of them plainly unſeaſonable. Both poets are
   eminently ſublime; but a difference may be remarked in the ſpecies of their ſublimity. Homer's
   ſublimity is accompanied with more impetuoſity and fire; Oſſian's with more of a ſolemn and awful
   grandeur. Homer hurries you along; Oſſian elevates, and fixes you in aſtoniſhment. Homer is moſt
   ſublime in actions and battles; Oſſian in deſcription and ſentiment. In the pathetic, Homer, when
   he chooſes to exert it, has great power; but Oſſian exerts that power much oftener, and has the
   character of tenderneſs far

No poet
   knew better how to ſeize and melt the heart. With regard to dignity of ſentiment, the
   pre-eminence muſt clearly he given to Oſſian. This is, indeed, a ſurpriſing circumſtance, that in
   point of humanity, magnanimity, virtuous feelings of every kind, our rude Celtic bard ſhould be
   diſtinguiſhed to ſuch a degree, that not only the heroes of Homer, but even thoſe of the polite
   and refined Virgil, are left far behind by thoſe of Oſſian.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">After</span> theſe general obſervations on the genius and ſpirit of our author, I
   now proceed to a nearer view and more accurate examination of his works; and as Fingal is the
   firſt great poem in this collection, it is proper to begin with it. To refuſe the title of an
   epic poem to Fingal, becauſe it is not, in every little particular, exactly conformable to the
   practice of Homer and Virgil, were the mere ſqueamiſhneſs and pedantry of criticiſm. Examined
   even according to Ariſtotle's rules, it will be found to have all the eſſential requiſites of a
   true and regular epic; and to have ſeveral of them in ſo high a degree, as at firſt view to raiſe
   our aſtoniſhment on finding Oſſian's compoſition ſo agreeable to rules of which he was entirely
   ignorant. But our aſtoniſhment will ceaſe, when we conſider

   Homer knew no more of the laws of criticiſm than Oſſian. But, guided by nature, he compoſed in
   verſe a regular ſtory, founded on heroic actions, which all poſterity admired. Ariſtotle, with
   great ſagacity and penetration, traced the cauſes of this general admiration. He obſerved what it
   was in Homer's compoſition, and in the conduct of his ſtory, which gave it ſuch power to pleaſe;
   from. this obſervation he deduced the rules which poets ought to follow, who would write and
   pleaſe like Homer; and to a compoſition formed according to ſuch rules, he gave the name of an
   epic poem. Hence his whole ſyſtem aroſe. Ariſtotle ſtudied nature in Homer. Homer and Oſſian both
   wrote from nature. No wonder that among all the three, there ſhould be ſuch agreement and
   conformity.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> fundamental rules delivered by Ariſtotle concerning an epic poem, are
   theſe: that the action, which is the groundwork of the poem, ſhould be one, complete, and great;
   that it ſhould be feigned, not merely hiſtorical; that it ſhould be enlivened with characters and
   manners, and heightened by the marvellous.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span>, before entering on any of theſe, it may perhaps be aſked, what is the
   moral of Fingal? For, according to M. Boſſu, an epic poem is
   <span class="page-number-image-wrapper"><span class="page-break">
                [

   illuſtrate ſome, moral truth. The poet, ſays this critic, muſt begin with fixing on ſome maxim or
   inſtruction, which he intends to inculcate on mankind. He next forms a fable, like one of Æſop's,
   wholly with a view to the moral; and having thus ſettled and arranged his plan, he then looks
   into traditionary hiſtory for names and incidents, to give his fable ſome air of probability.
   Never did a more frigid, pedantic notion enter into the mind of a critic. We may ſafely
   pronounce, that he who ſhould compoſe an epic poem after this manner, who ſhould firſt lay down a
   moral and contrive a plan, before he had thought of his perſonages and actors, might deliver,
   indeed, very ſound inſtruction, but would find very few readers. There cannot be the leaſt doubt
   that the firſt object which ſtrikes an epic poet, which fires his genius, and gives him any idea
   of his work, is the action or ſubject he is to celebrate. Hardly is there any tale, any ſubject,
   a poet can chooſe for ſuch a work, but will afford ſome general moral inſtruction. An epic poem
   is, by its nature, one of the moſt moral of all poetical compoſitions: but its moral tendency is
   by no means to be limited to ſome commonplace maxim, which may be gathered from the ſtory. It
   ariſes from the admiration of heroic actions,

   calculated to produce; from the virtuous emotions which the characters and incidents raiſe,
   whilſt we read it; from the happy impreſſions which all the parts ſeparately, as well as the
   whole together, leave upon the mind. However, if a general moral be ſtill inſiſted on, Fingal
   obviouſly furniſhes one, not inferior to that of any other poet, viz: that wiſdom and bravery
   always triumph over brutal force: or another, nobler ſtill: that the moſt complete victory over
   an enemy is obtained by that moderation and generoſity which convert him into a friend.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> unity of the epic action, which of all Ariſtotle's rules, is the chief
   and moſt material, is ſo ſtrictly preſerved in Fingal, that it muſt be perceived by every reader.
   It is a more complete unity than what ariſes from relating the actions of one man, which the
   Greek critic juſtly cenſures as imperfect: it is the unity of one enterpriſe—the deliverance of
   Ireland from the invaſion of Swaran; an enterpriſe which has ſurely the full heroic dignity. All
   the incidents recorded bear a conſtant reference to one end; no double plot is carried on; but
   the pa unite into a regular whole; and as the action is one and great, ſo it is an entire or
   complete action. For we find, as the critic, farther

   a nodus, or intrigue, in the poem; difficulties occurring through Cuthullin's raſhneſs and bad
   ſucceſs; thoſe difficulties gradually ſurmounted; and at laſt, the work conducted to that happy
   concluſion which is held eſſential to epic poetry. Unity is, indeed, obſerved with greater
   exactneſs in Fingal, than in almoſt any other epic compoſition. For not only is unity of ſubject
   maintained, but that of time and place alſo. The autumn is clearly pointed out as the ſeaſon of
   the action; and from beginning to end the ſcene is never ſhifted from the heath of Lena, along
   the ſeaſhore. The duration of the action in Fingal, is much ſhorter than in the Iliad or Æneid;
   but ſure there may be ſhorter as well longer heroic poems; and if the authority of Ariſtotle be
   alſo required for this, he ſays expreſſly, that the epic compoſition is indefinite as to the time
   of its duration. Accordingly, the action of the Iliad laſts only forty-ſeven days, whilſt that of
   the Æneid is continued for more than a year.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Throughout</span> the whole of Fingal, there reigns that grandeur of ſentiment,
   ſtyle, and imagery, which ought ever to diſtinguiſh this high ſpecies of poetry. The ſtory is
   conducted with no ſmall art. The poet goes not back to a

   in an animated manner, with the ſituation of Cuthullin, and the arrival of a ſcout, who informs
   him of Swaran's landing. Mention is preſently made of Fingal, and of the expected aſſiſtance from
   the ſhips of the lonely iſle, in order to give farther light to the ſubject. For the poet often

   poet of the moſt refined times. Homer's art in magnifying the character of Achilles, has been
   univerſally admired. Oſſian certainly ſhews no leſs aft in aggrandizing Fingal. Nothing could be
   more happily imagined for this purpoſe than the whole management of the laſt battle, wherein
   Gaul, the ſon of Morni, had beſought Fingal to retire, and to leave him and his other chiefs the
   honour of the day. The generoſity of the king in agreeing to this propoſal; the majeſty with
   which he retreats to the hill, from whence he was to behold the engagement, attended by his
   bards, and waving the lightning of his ſword; his perceiving the chiefs overpowered by numbers,
   but, from unwillingneſs to deprive them of the glory of victory by coming in perſon to their
   aſſiſtance, firſt ſending Ullin, the bard, to animate their courage, and at laſt, when the danger
   becomes more preſſing, his riſing in his might, and interpoſing, like a divinity, to decide the

   concerning a female ſlave; on which Achilles, apprehending himſelf to be injured, withdraws his
   aſſiſtance from the reſt of the Greeks. The Greeks fall into great diſtreſs, and beſeech him to
   be reconciled to them. He refuſes to fight for them in perſon, but ſends his friend Patroclus;
   and upon his being ſlain, goes forth to revenge his death, and kills Hector. The ſubject of
   Fingal is this: Swaran comes to invade Ireland; Cuthullin, the guardian of the young king, had
   applied for his aſſiſtance to Fingal, who reigned in the oppoſite coaſt of Scotland. But before
   Fingal's arrival, he is hurried by raſh counſel to encounter Swaran. He is defeated; he retreats,
   and deſponds. Fingal arrives in this conjuncture. The battle is for ſome time dubious; but in the
   end he conquers Swaran; and the remembrance of Swaran's being the brother of Agandecca, who, had
   once ſaved his life, makes him diſmiſs him honourably. Homer, it is true, has filled up his ſtory
   with a much greater variety of particulars than Oſſian; and in this has ſhown a compaſs of
   invention ſuperior to that of the other poet. But it muſt not be forgotten that though Homer be

   notwithſtanding all the fertility of Homer's invention, there is ſo much uniformity in his
   ſubjects, that there are few readers, who, before the cloſe, are not tired with perpetual
   fighting. Whereas in Oſſian, the mind is relieved by a more agreeable diverſity. There is a finer
   mixture of war and heroiſm, with love and friendſhip—of martial, with tender ſcones, than is to
   be met with, perhaps, in any other poet. The epiſodes, too, have great propriety—as natural, and
   proper to that age and country: conſiſting of the ſongs of bards, which are known to have been
   the great entertainment of the Celtic heroes in war, as well as in peace. Theſe ſongs are not
   introduced at random; if you except the epiſode of Duchommar and Morna, in the firſt book, which,
   though beautiful, is more unartful than any of the reſt, they have always ſome particular
   relation to the actor who is intereſted, or to the events which are going on; and, whilſt they
   vary the ſcene, they preſerve a ſufficient connection with the main ſubject by the fitneſs and
   propriety of their introduction.</p>

But as it lay
   without the compaſs of the preſent action, it could be regularly introduced nowhere except in an
   epiſode. Accordingly, the poet, with as much propriety as if Ariſtotle himſelf had directed the
   plan, has contrived an epiſode for this purpoſe in the ſong of Carril, at the beginning of the
   third book.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> concluſion of the poem is ſtrictly according to rule, and is every way
   noble and pleaſing. Th reconciliation of the contending heroes, the conſolation of Cuthullin, and
   the general felicity that crowns the action, ſoothe the mind in a very agreeable manner, and form
   that paſſage from agitation and trouble, to perfect quiet and repoſe, which critics require as
   the proper termination of the epic work. “Thus they paſſed the night in ſong, and brought back
   the morning with joy. Fingal aroſe on the heath; and ſhook his glittering ſpear in his hand. He
   moved firſt towards the plains of Lena; and we followed like a ridge of fire. Spread the ſail,
   ſaid the king of Morven, and catch the winds that pour from Lena. We roſe on the waves with
   ſongs; and ruſhed with joy through the foam of the ocean.” So much for the unity and general
   conduct of the Epic action in Fingal.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">With</span> regard to that property of the ſubject which Ariſtotle requires, that
   it ſhould be feigned, not hiſtorical, he muſt not be underſtood ſo ſtrictly is if he meant to
   exclude all ſubjects which have any foundation in truth. For ſuch excluſion would both be
   unreaſonable in itſelf, and what is more, would be contrary to the practice of Homer, who is
   known to have founded his Iliad on hiſtorical facts concerning the war of Troy, which was famous
   throughout all Greece. Ariſtotle means no more than that it is the buſineſs of a poet not to be a
   more annaliſt of facts, but to embelliſh truth with beautiful, probable, and uſeful fictions; to
   copy nature as he himſelf explains it, like painters, who preſerve a likeneſs, but exhibit their
   objects more grand and beautiful than they are in reality. That Oſſian has followed this courſe,
   and building upon true hiſtory, has ſufficiently adorned it with poetical fiction for
   aggrandizing his characters and facts, will not, I believe, be queſtioned by moſt readers. At the
   ſame time, the foundation which thoſe facts and characters had in truth, and the ſhare which the
   poet had himſelf in the tranſactions which he records, muſt be conſidered as no ſmall advantage

   events ſo feelingly as thoſe in which he has been intereſted; paints any ſcene ſo naturally as
   one which he has ſeen; or draws any characters in ſuch ſtrong colours as thoſe which he has
   perſonally known. It is conſidered as an advantage of the epic ſubject to be taken from a period
   ſo diſtant, as, by being involved in the darkneſs of tradition, may give licenſe to fable. Though
   Oſſian's ſubject may at firſt view appear unfavourable in this reſpect, as being taken from his
   own times, yet, when we reflect that he lived to an extreme old age; that he relates what had
   been tranſacted in another country, at the diſtance of many years, and after all that race of men
   who had been the actors were gone off the ſtage; we ſhall find the objection in a great meaſure
   obviated. In ſo rude an age, when no written records were known, when tradition was looſe, and
   accuracy of any kind little attended to, what was great and heroic in one generation, eaſily
   ripened into the marvellous in the next.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> natural repreſentation of human character in an epic poem is highly
   eſſential to its merit; and, in reſpect of this, there can be no doubt of Homer's excelling all

   ſuperior to Virgil; and has, indeed, given all the diſplay of human nature, which the ſimple
   occurrences of his times could be expected to furniſh. No dead uniformity of character prevails
   in Fingal; but, on the contrary, the principal characters are not only clearly diſtinguiſhed, but
   ſometimes artfully contraſted, ſo as to illuſtrate each other. Oſſian's heroes are like Homer's,
   all brave; but their bravery, like thoſe of Homer's too, is of different kinds. For inſtance: the
   prudent, the ſedate, the modeſt and circumſpect Connal, is finely oppoſed to the preſumptuous,
   raſh, overbearing, but gallant and generous Calmar. Calmar hurries Cuthullin into action by his
   temerity; and when he ſees the bad effects of his counſels, he will not ſurvive the diſgrace.
   Connal, like another Ulyſſes, attends Cuthullin to his retreat, counſels and comforts him under
   his miſfortune. The fierce, the proud, and the high-ſpirited Swaran, is admirably contraſted with
   the calm, the moderate, and generous Fingal. The character of Oſcar is a favourite one throughout
   the whole poems. The amiable warmth of the young warrior; his eager impetuoſity in the day of
   action; his paſſion for fame; his ſubmiſſion to his father; his tenderneſs for Malvina; are the
   ſtrokes of a maſterly
   <span class="page-number-image-wrapper"><span class="page-break">

   hand of nature, and attracts the heart. Oſſian's own character, the old man, the hero, and the
   bard, all in one, preſents to us, through the whole work, a moſt reſpectable and venerable
   figure, which we always contemplate with pleaſure. Cuthullin is a hero of the higheſt claſs:
   daring, magnanimous, and exquiſitely ſenſible to honour. We become attached to his intereſt, and
   are deeply touched with his diſtreſs; and after the admiration raiſed for him in the firſt part
   of the poem, it is a ſtrong proof of Oſſian's maſterly genius, that he durſt adventure to produce
   to us another hero, compared with whom, even the great Cuthullin ſhould be only an inferior
   perſonage; and who ſhould riſe as far above him, as Cuthullin riſes above the reſt.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Here</span> indeed, in the character and deſcription of Fingal, Oſſian triumphs
   almoſt unrivalled; for we may boldly defy all antiquity to ſhow us any hero equal to Fingal.
   Homer's Hector poſſeſſes ſeveral great and amiable qualities; but Hector is a ſecondary perſonage
   in the Iliad, not the hero of the work. We ſee him only occaſionally; we know much leſs of him
   than we do of Fingal; who, not only in this, epic poem, but in Temora, and throughout the reſt of
   Oſſian's works, is preſented in all that variety of

   character. And though Hector faithfully diſcharges his duty to his country, his friends, and his
   family, he is tinctured, however, with a degree of the ſame ſavage ferocity which prevails among
   all the Homeric heroes: for we find him inſulting over the fallen Patroclus with the moſt cruel
   taunts, and telling him, when he lies in the agonies of death, that Achilles cannot help him now;
   and that in a ſhort time his body, ſtripped naked, and deprived of funeral honours, ſhall be
   devoured by the vultures<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333821024"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>. Whereas, in the character of Fingal, concur almoſt
   all the qualities that can ennoble human nature; that can either make us admire the hero, or love
   the man. He is not only unconquerable in war, but he makes his people happy by his wiſdom in the
   days of peace. He is truly too father of his people. He is known by the epithet or “Fingal of the
   mildeſt look;” and diſtinguiſhed on every occaſion by humanity and generoſity. He is merciful to

   friends; and never mentions Agandecca, his firſt love, without the utmoſt tenderneſs. He is the
   univerſal Protector of the diſtreſſed; “None ever went ſad from Fingal.”—“O, Oſcar! bend the
   ſtrong in arms; but ſpare the feeble hand. Be thou a ſtream of mighty tides againſt the foes of
   thy people; but like the gale that moves the graſs to thoſe who aſk thine aid. So Trenmor lived;
   ſuch Trathal was; and ſuch has Fingal been. My arm was the ſupport of the injured; the weak
   reſted behind the lightning of my ſteel.” Theſe were the maxims of true heroiſm, to which he
   formed his grandſon. His fame is repreſented as everywhere ſpread; the greateſt heroes
   acknowledge his ſuperiority; his enemies tremble at his name; and the higheſt encomium that can
   be beſtowed on one whom the poets would moſt exalt, is to ſay, that his ſoul was like the ſoul of
   Fingal.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">To</span> do juſtice to the poet's merit, in ſupporting ſuch a character as this, I

   difficult, than to draw a perfect character in ſuch a manner as to render it diſtinct, and
   affecting to the mind. Some ſtrokes of human imperfection and frailty, are what uſually give us
   the moſt clear view, and the moſt ſenſible impreſſion of a character; becauſe they preſent to us
   a man, ſuch as we have ſeen; they recall known features of human nature. When poets attempt to go
   beyond this range, and deſcribe a faultleſs hero, they for the moſt part ſet before us a ſort of
   vague, undiſtinguiſhable character, ſuch as the imagination cannot lay hold of, or realize to
   itſelf as the object of affection. We know how much Virgil has failed in this particular. His
   perfect hero, Æneas, is an unanimated, inſipid perſonage, whom we may pretend to admire, but whom
   no one can heartily love. But what Virgil has failed in, Oſſian, to our aſtoniſhment, has
   ſucceſſfully executed. His Fingal, though exhibited without any of the common human failings, is,
   nevertheleſs, a real man; a character which touches and intereſts every reader. To this it has
   much contributed that the poet has repreſented him as an old man; and by this has gained the
   advantage of throwing around him a great many circumſtances, peculiar to that age, which paint
   him to the fancy in a more diſtinct
   <span class="page-number-image-wrapper"><span class="page-break">

He is ſurrounded with his family; he
   inſtructs his children in the principles of virtue; he is narrative of his paſt exploits he is
   venerable with the gray locks of age; he is frequently diſpoſed to moralize, like an old man, on
   human vanity, and the proſpect of death. There is more art, at leaſt more felicity, in this, than
   may at firſt be imagined. For youth and old are the two ſtates of human life, capable of being
   placed in the moſt pictureſque lights. Middle age is more general and vague; and has fewer
   circumſtances peculiar to the idea of it. And when any object is in a ſituation that admits it to
   be rendered particular, and to be clothed with a variety of circumſtances, it always ſtands out
   more clear and full of poetical deſcription.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Beſides</span> human perſonages, divine or ſupernatural agents are often introduced
   into epic poetry, forming what is called the machinery of it; which moſt critics hold to be an
   eſſential part. The marvellous, it muſt he admitted, has always a great charm for the bulk of
   readers. It gratifies the imagination, and affords room for ſtriking and ſublime deſcription. No
   wonder, therefore, that all poets ſhould have a ſtrong propenſity towards it. But I muſt obſerve,
   that nothing is more difficult than to adjuſt properly the marvellous with the probable. If a

   with extravagant ſupernatural ſcenes, he ſpreads over it an appearance of romance and childiſh
   fiction; he tranſports his readers from this world into a fantaſtic viſionary region; and loſes
   that weight and dignity which ſhould reign in epic poetry. No work from which probability is
   altogether baniſhed, can make a laſting or deep impreſſion. Human actions and manners are always,
   the moſt intereſting objects which can be preſented to a human mind. All machinery, therefore, is
   faulty, which withdraws theſe too much from view, or obſcures them under a cloud of incredible
   fictions. Beſides being temperately employed, machinery ought always to have ſome foundation in
   popular belief. A poet is by no means at liberty to invent what ſyſtem of the marvellous he
   pleaſes; he muſt avail himſelf either of the religious faith, or the ſuperſtitious credulity of
   the country wherein he lives; ſo as to give an air of probability to events which are moſt
   contrary to the common courſe of nature.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> theſe reſpects, Oſſian appears to me to have been remarkably happy. He
   has, indeed, followed the ſame courſe with Homer. For it is perfectly abſurd to imagine, as ſome
   critics have done, that Homer's mythology was invented by

   on the benefits it would yield to poetry.” Homer was no ſuch refining genius. He found the
   traditionary ſtories, on which he built his Iliad, mingled with popular legends concerning the
   intervention of the gods; and he adopted theſe becauſe they amuſed the fancy. Oſſian, in like
   manner, found the tales of his country full of ghoſts and ſpirits; it is likely he believed them
   himſelf; and he introduced them, becauſe they gave his poems that ſolemn and marvellous caſt
   which ſuited his genius. This was the only machinery he could employ with propriety; becauſe it
   was the only intervention of ſupernatural beings which agreed with the common belief of the
   country. It was happy; becauſe it did not interfere in the leaſt with the proper diſplay of human
   characters and actions; becauſe it had leſs of the incredible than moſt other kinds of poetical
   machinery; and becauſe it ſerved to diverſify the ſcene, and to heighten the ſubject by an awful
   grandeur, which is the great deſign of machinery.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">As</span> Oſſian's mythology is peculiar to himſelf, and makes a conſiderable
   figure in his other poems, as well as in Fingal, it may be proper to make ſome obſervations on
   it, independent of its ſubſerviency to epic compoſition. It turns

   departed ſpirits. Theſe, conſonantly to the notions of every rude age, are repreſented not as
   purely immaterial, but as thin airy forms, which can be viſible or inviſible at pleaſure; their
   voice is feeble, their arm is weak; but they are endowed with knowledge more than human. In a
   ſeparate ſtate, they retain the ſame diſpoſitions which animated them in this life. They ride on
   the wind; they bend their airy bows; and purſue deer formed of clouds. The ghoſts of departed
   bards continue to ſing. The ghoſts of departed heroes frequent the fields of their former fame.
   “They reſt together in their caves, and talk of mortal men. Their ſongs are of other worlds. They
   come ſometimes to the ear of reſt, and raiſe their feeble voice.” All this preſents to us much
   the ſame ſet of ideas concerning ſpirits, as we find in the eleventh book of the Odyſſey, where
   Ulyſſes viſits the regions of the dead; and in the twenty-third book of the Iliad, the ghoſt of
   Patroclus, after appearing to Achilles, vaniſhes preciſely like one of Oſſian's, emitting a
   ſhrill, feeble cry, and melting away like ſmoke.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> though Homer's and Oſſian's ideas concerning ghoſts were of the ſame

Oſſian deſcribes ghoſts
   with all the particularity of one who had ſeen and converſed with them, and whoſe imagination was
   full of the impreſſion they had left upon it. He calls up thoſe awful and tremendous ideas which
   the <span class="quote">
   <span class="line">—Simulacra modis pallentia miris</span> </span> are fitted to raiſe in the human mind; and
   which, in Shakſpeare's ſtyle, “harrow up the ſoul.” Crugal's ghoſt, in particular, in the
   beginning of the ſecond book of Fingal, may vie with any appearance of this kind, deſcribed by
   any epic or tragic poet whatever. Moſt poets would have contented themſelves, with telling us,
   that he reſembled, in every particular, the living Crugal; that his form and dreſs were the ſame,
   only his face more pale and ſad; and that he bore the mark of the wound by which he fell. But
   Oſſian ſets before our eyes a ſpirit from the inviſible world, diſtinguiſhed by all thoſe
   features which a ſtrong, aſtoniſhed imagination would give to a ghoſt. “A dark red ſtream of fire
   comes down from the hill. Crugal ſat upon the beam; he that lately fell by the band of Swaran,
   ſtriving in the battle of heroes. His face is like the beam of the ſetting moon. His robes are of

His eyes are like two decaying
   flames. Dark is the wound of his breaſt.—The ſtars dim twinkled through his form; and his voice
   was like the ſound of a diſtant ſtream.” The circumſtance of the ſtars being beheld “dim
   twinkling through his form,” is wonderfully pictureſque, and convoys the moſt lively impreſſion
   of his thin and ſhadowy ſubſtance. The attitude in which he is afterward placed, and the ſpeech
   put into his mouth, are full of that ſolemn and awful ſublimity, which ſuits the ſubject. “Dim,
   and in tears he ſtood, and he ſtretched his pale hand over the hero. Faintly he raiſed his feeble
   voice, like the gale of the reedy Lego.—My ghoſt, O Connal! is on my native hills; but my corſe
   is on the ſands of Ulla. Thou ſhalt never talk with Crugal, or find his lone ſteps in the heath.
   I am light as the blaſt of Cromla; and I move like the ſhadow of miſt. Connal, ſon of Colgar! I
   ſee the dark cloud of death; it hovers over the plains of Lena. The ſons of green Erin Shall
   fall. Remove from the field of ghoſts.—Like the darkened moon, he retired in the midſt of the
   whiſtling blaſt.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Several</span> other appearances of ſpirits might be pointed out, as among the moſt

   ſcenery always ſuited to the occaſion. “Oſcar ſlowly aſcends the hill. The meteors of night ſet
   on the heath before him. A diſtant torrent faintly roars. Unfrequent blaſts ruſh through aged
   oaks. The half enlightened moon ſinks dim and red behind her hill. Feeble voices are heard on the
   heath. Oſcar drew his ſword—.”Nothing can prepare the fancy more happily for the awful ſcene that
   is to follow. “Trenmor came from his hill at the voice of his mighty ſon. A cloud, like the ſteed
   of the ſtranger, ſupported his airy limbs. His robe is of the miſt of Lano, that brings death to
   the people. His ſword is a green meteor, half extinguiſhed. His face is without form, and dark.
   He ſighed thrice over the hero; and thrice the winds of the night roared around. Many were his
   words to Oſcar.—He ſlowly vaniſhed, like a miſt that melts on the ſunny hill.” To appearances of
   this kind, we can find no parallel among the Greek or Roman poets. They bring to mind that noble
   deſcription in the book of Job: “In thoughts from the viſion of the night, when deep ſleep
   falleth on men, fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to ſhake. Then a ſpirit

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">As</span> Oſſian's ſupernatural beings are deſcribed with a ſurpriſing force of
   imagination, ſo they are introduced with propriety. We have only three ghoſts in Fingal: that of
   Crugal, which comes to warn the hoſt of impending deſtruction, and to adviſe them to ſave
   themſelves by retreat; that of Evir-allen, the ſpouſe of Oſſian, which calls on him to riſe and
   reſcue their ſon from danger; and that of Agandecca, which, juſt before the laſt engagement with
   Swaran, moves Fingal to pity, by mourning for the approaching deſtruction of her kinſman and
   people. In the other poems, ghoſts ſometimes appear, when invoked, to foretell futurity;
   frequently, according to the notions of theſe times, they come as forerunners of miſfortune or
   death, to thoſe whom they viſit; ſometimes they inform their friends at a diſtance of thier own
   death; and ſometimes they are introduced to heighten the ſcenery on ſome great and ſolemn
   occaſion.

   faces of other times looked from the clouds of Crona.”—“Fercuth! I ſaw the ghoſt of night. Silent

   living character is ſtill preſerved. This is remarkable in the appearance of Calmar's ghoſt, in
   the poem entitled, The death of Cuthullin. He ſeems to forebode Cuthullin's death, and to beckon
   him to his cave. Cuthullin reproaches him for ſuppoſing that he could be intimidated by ſuch
   prognoſtics. “Why doſt thou bend thy dark eyes on me, ghoſt of the car-borne Calmar? Wouldſt thou

   praiſe.” This is preciſely the ghoſt of Achilles in Homer; who, notwithſtanding all the
   diſſatiſfaction he expreſſes with his ſtate in the region of the dead, as ſoon as he had heard

   temporary, like that of moſt other ancient poets; which of courſe is apt to ſeem ridiculous,
   after the ſuperſtitions have paſſed away on which it is founded. Oſſian's mythology is, to ſpeak
   ſo, the mythology of human nature; for it is founded on what has been the popular belief, in all

The indecent ſquabbles among his
   gods ſurely do no honour to epic poetry. Whereas Oſſian's machinery has dignity upon all
   occaſions. It is indeed a dignity of the dark and awful kind; but this is proper; becauſe
   coincident with the ſtrain and ſpirit of the poetry. A light and gay mythology, like Homer's,
   would have been perfectly unſuitable to the ſubjects on which Oſſian's genius was employed. But
   though his machinery be always ſolemn, it is not, however, always dreary or diſmal; it as
   enlivened, as much as the ſubject would permit, by thoſe pleaſant and beautiful appearances,
   which he ſometimes introduces, of the ſpirits of the hill. Theſe are gentle ſpirits: deſcending
   on ſunbeams, fair moving on the plain; their forms white and bright; their voices ſweet; and
   their viſits to men propitious. The greateſt praiſe that can be given to the beauty of a living
   woman, is to ſay, “She is fair as the ghoſt of the hill, when it moves in a ſunbeam at noon, over
   the ſilence of Morven.” “The hunter ſhall hear my voice from his booth. He ſhall fear, but love

Spirits of a ſuperior
   nature to ghoſts are ſometimes alluded to, which have power to embroil the deep; to call forth
   winds and ſtorms, and pour them on the land of the ſtranger; to overturn foreſts, and to ſend
   death among the people. We have prodigies too; a ſhower of blood; and when ſome diſaſter is
   befalling at a diſtance, the ſound of death is heard on the ſtrings of Oſſian's harp: all
   perfectly conſonant, not only to the peculiar ideas of northern nations, but to the general
   current of a ſuperſtitious mention in all countries. The deſcription of Fingal's airy hall, in
   the poem called Errathon, and of the aſcent of Malvina into it, deſerves particular notice, as
   remarkably noble and magnificent. But, above all, the engagement of Fingal with the ſpirit of
   Loda, in Carric-thura, cannot be mentioned without admiration. I forbear tranſcribing the
   paſſage, as it muſt have drawn the attention of every one who has read the works of Oſſian. The
   undaunted courage of Fingal, oppoſed to all the terrors of the Scandinavian god; the appearance
   and the ſpeech of that awful ſpirit; the wound which he receives, and the ſhriek which he ſends

   author. The fiction is calculated to aggrandize the hero; which it does to a high degree: nor is
   it ſo unnatural or wild a fiction as might at firſt be thought. According to the notions of thoſe
   times, ſupernatural beings were material, and, conſequently, vulnerable. The ſpirit of Loda was
   not acknowledged as a deity by Fingal; he did not worſhip at the ſtone of his power; he plainly
   conſidered him as the god of his enemies only; as a local deity, whoſe dominion extended no
   farther than to the regions where he was worſhipped; who had, therefore, no title to threaten
   him, and no claim to his ſubmiſſion. We know there are poetical precedents of great authority,
   for fictions fully as extravagant; and if Homer be forgiven for making Diomed attack and wound in
   battle the gods whom that chief himſelf worſhipped, Oſſian ſurely is pardonable for making his

   diſcovered ſome knowledge of a Supreme Being. Although his ſilence on this head has been
   accounted for by the learned and ingenious tranſlator in a very probable, manner, yet ſtill it
   muſt be held a conſiderable diſadvantage to the poetry. For the moſt auguſt and lofty ideas that
   can embelliſh poetry are derived from the belief of a divine adminiſtration of the univerſe; and
   hence the invocation of a Supreme Being, or at leaſt of ſome ſuperior powers, who are conceived

   what an illuſtrious figure they would have made under the management of ſuch a genius as his; and
   how finely they would have been adapted to many ſituations which occur in his works.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">After</span> ſo particular an examination of Fingal, it were needleſs to enter into

   both. The high merit, however, of Temora, requires that we ſhould not paſs it by without ſome
   remarks.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſcene of Temora, as of Fingal, is laid in Ireland; and the action is of

   undertaking worthy of the juſtice and heroiſm of the great Fingal. The action is one, and
   complete. The Poem opens with the deſcent of Fingal on the coaſt, and the conſultation held among
   the chiefs of the enemy. The murder of the young

   war, being antecedent to the epic action, is introduced with great propriety as an epiſode in the
   firſt book. In the progreſs of the poem, three battles are deſcribed, which riſe in their
   importance above, one another; the ſucceſs is various, and the iſſue for ſome time doubtful; till
   at laſt, Fingal, brought into diſtreſs, by the wound of his great general Gaul, and the death of
   his ſon Fillan, aſſumes the command himſelf; and, having ſlain the Iriſh king in ſingle combat,
   reſtores the rightful heir to his throne.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Temora</span> has perhaps leſs fire than the other epic poem; but in return it has
   more variety, more tenderneſs, and more magnificence. The reigning idea, ſo often reſented to us,
   of “Fingal, in the laſt of his fields, is venerable and affecting; nor could any more noble
   concluſion be thought of, than the aged hero, after ſo many ſucceſſful achievements, taking his
   leave of battles, and, with all the ſolemnities of thoſe times, reſigning his ſpear to his ſon.
   The events are leſs crowded in Temora than in Fingal; actions and characters are more

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> moſt of our author's poems, the horrors of war are ſoftened by intermixed
   ſcenes of love and friendſhip. In Fingal theſe are introduced as epiſodes: in Temora we have an
   incident of this nature wrought into the body of the piece, in the adventure of Cathmor and
   Sulmalla. This forms one of the moſt conſpicuous beauties of that poem. The diſtreſs of Sulmalla,
   diſguiſed and unknown amongſt ſtrangers, her tender and anxious concern for the ſafety of
   Cathmor, her dream, and her melting remembrance of the land of her fathers; Cathmor's emotion
   when he firſt diſcovers her, his ſtruggles to conceal and ſuppreſs his paſſion, leſt it ſhould
   unman him in the midſt of war, though “his ſoul poured forth in ſecret, when he beheld her

   feature, they are nevertheleſs diverſified in a ſenſible and ſtriking manner. Foldath, for
   inſtance, the general of Cathmor, exhibits the perfect picture of a ſavage chieftain; bold and
   daring, but preſumptuous, cruel, and overbearing. He is diſtinguiſhed, on his firſt appearance,
   as the friend of the tyrant Cairbar, “His ſtride is haughty; his red eye rolls in wrath.” In his
   perſon and whole deportment he is contraſted with the mild and wiſe Hidalla, another leader of
   the ſame army, on whoſe humanity and gentleneſs he looks with great contempt. He profeſſedly
   delights in ſtrife and blood. He inſults over the fallen. He is imperious in his counſels, and
   factious when they are not followed. He is unrelenting in all his ſchemes of revenge, even to the
   length of denying the funeral ſong to the dead; which, from the injury thereby done to their
   ghoſts, was in thoſe days conſidered as the greateſt barbarity. Fierce to the laſt, he comforts
   himſelf in his dying moments with thinking that his ghoſt ſhall often leave its blaſt to rejoice
   over the graves of thoſe he had ſlain. Yet Oſſian, ever prone to the pathetic, has contrived to
   throw into his account of the death, even of this man, ſome tender

   his daughter Dardulena, the laſt of his race.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> character of Foldath tends much to exalt that of Cathmor, the chief
   commander, which is diſtinguiſhed by the moſt humane virtues. He all fraud and cruelty, is famous
   for his hoſpitality to ſtrangers; open to every generous ſentiment, and to every ſoft and
   compaſſionate feeling. he is ſo amiable as to divide the reader's attachment between him and the
   hero of the poem; though our author has artfully managed it ſo as to make Cathmor himſelf
   indirectly acknowledge Fingal's ſuperiority, and to appear ſomewhat apprehenſive of the event,
   after the death of Fillan, which he knew would call forth Fingal in all his might. It is very
   remarkable, that although Oſſian has introduced into his poems three complete heroes, Cuthullin,
   Cathmor, and Fingal, he has, however, ſenſibly diſtinguiſhed each of their characters; Cuthullin
   is particularly honourable; Cathmor particularly amiable; Fingal wiſe and great, retaining an
   aſcendant peculiar to himſelf in whatever light he is viewed.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> the favourite figure in Temora, and the one moſt highly finiſhed, is
   Fillan. His character is of that ſort for which Oſſian ſhews a

   young warrior, fired with all the impatient enthuſiaſm for military glory peculiar to that time
   of life. He had ſketched this in the deſcription of his own ſon Oſcar; but as he has extended it
   more fully in Fillan, and as the character is ſo conſonant to the epic ſtrain, though, as far as
   I remember, not placed in ſuch a conſpicuous light by any other epic poet, it may be worth while
   to attend a little to Oſſian's management of it in this inſtance.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Fillan</span> was the youngeſt of all the ſons of Fingal younger, it is plain, than
   his nephew Oſcar, by whoſe fame and great deeds in war we may naturally ſuppoſe his ambition to
   have been highly ſtimulated. Withal, as lie is younger, he is deſcribed as more raſh and fiery.
   His firſt appearance is ſoon after Oſcar's death, when he was employed to watch the motions of
   the foe by night. In a converſation with his brother Oſſian, on that occaſion, we learn that it
   was not long ſince he began to lift the ſpear. “Few are the marks of my ſword in battle; but my
   ſoul is fire.” He is with ſome difficulty reſtrained by Oſſian from going to attack the enemy;
   and complains to him, that his father had never allowed him any opportunity of ſignalizing his
   valor. “The king hath not

   crowd; I return without my fame.” Soon after, when Fingal, according to cuſtom, was to appoint
   one of his chiefs to command the army, and each was ſtanding forth, and putting in his claim to
   this honour, Fillan is preſented in the following moſt pictureſque and natural attitude: “On his
   ſpear ſtood the Son of Clatho, in the wandering of his locks. Thrice he raiſed his eyes to
   Fingal; his voice thrice failed him as he ſpoke. Fillan could not boaſt of battles; at once he
   ſtrode away. Bent over a diſtant ſtream he ſtood; the tear hung in his eye. He ſtruck, at times,
   the thiſtle's head with his inverted ſpear.” No leſs natural and beautiful is the deſcription of
   Fingal's paternal emotion on this occaſion. “Nor is he unſeen of Fingal. Sidelong he beheld his
   ſon. He beheld him with burſting joy. He hid the big tear with his locks, and turned amidſt his
   crowded ſoul.” The command, for that day, being given to Gaul, Fillan ruſhes amidſt the thickeſt
   of the foe, ſaves Gaul's life, who is wounded by a random arrow, and diſtinguiſhes himſelf ſo in
   battle, that “the days of old return on Fingal's mind, as he beholds the renown of his ſon. As
   the ſun rejoices from the cloud, over the tree his beams have raiſed,

   heath, ſo joyful is the king over Fillan.” Sedate, however, and wiſe, he mixes the praiſe which
   he beſtows on him with ſome reprehenſion of his raſhneſs. “My ſon, I ſaw thy deeds, and my ſoul
   was glad. Thou art brave, ſon of Clatho, but headlong in the ſtrife. So did not Fingal advance,
   though he never feared a foe. Let thy people be a ridge behind thee; they are thy ſtrength in the
   field. Then ſhalt thou be long renowned, and behold the tombs of thy fathers.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">On </span>the next day, the, greateſt and the laſt of Fillan's life, the charge is
   committed to him of leading on the hoſt to battle. Fingal's ſpeech to his troops on this occaſion
   is full of noble ſentiment; and, where he recommends his ſon to their care, extremely touching.
   “A young beam is before you: few are his ſteps to war. They are few, but he is valiant; defend my
   dark-haired ſon. Bring him back with joy; hereafter he may ſtand alone. His form is like his
   fathers; his ſoul is a flame of their fire.” When the battle begins, the poet puts forth his
   ſtrength to deſcribe the exploits of the young hero; who, at laſt encountering and killing with
   his own hand Foldath, the oppoſite general, attains the pinnacle of glory. In what

   near, Oſſian, if anywhere, excels himſelf. Foldath being ſlain, and a general rout begun, there
   was no reſource left to the enemy but in the great Cathmore himſelf, who in this extremity
   deſcends from the hill, where, according to the cuſtom of thoſe princes, he ſurveyed the battle.
   Obſerve how this critical event is wrought up by the poet. “Wide-ſpreading over echoing Lubar,
   the flight of Bolga is rolled along. Fillan hung forward on their ſteps, and ſtrewed the heath
   with dead. Fingal rejoiced over his ſon.—Blue-ſhielded Cathmor roſe.—Son of Alpin, bring the
   harp! Give Fillan's praiſe to the wind: raiſe high his praiſe in my hall, while yet he ſhines in
   war. Leave, blue-eyed Clatho! leave thy hall; behold that early beam of thine! The hoſt is
   withered in its courſe. No farther look—it is dark—light trembling from the harp, ſtrike,
   virgins! ſtrike the ſound.” The ſudden interruption and ſuſpenſe of the narration on Cathmor's
   riſing from his hill, the abrupt burſting into the praiſe of Fillan, and the paſſionate
   apoſtrophe to his mother Clatho, are admirable efforts of poetical art, in order to intereſt us
   in Fillan's danger; and the whole is heightened by the immediate following ſimile,

   is to be met with in any poet, and which, if it had been found in Homer, would have been the
   frequent ſubject of admiration to critics: “Fillan is like a ſpirit of heaven, that deſcends from
   the ſkirt of big blaſt. The troubled ocean feels his ſteps as he ſtrides from wave to wave. His
   path kindles behind him; iſlands ſhake their heads on the heaving ſeas.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> the poet's art is not yet exhauſted. The fall of this noble young,
   warrior, or, in Oſſian's ſtyle, the extinction of this beam of heaven, could not be rendered too
   intereſting and affecting. Our attention is naturally drawn towards Fingal. He beholds front his
   hill the riſing of Cathmor, and the danger of his ſon. But what ſhall he do? “Shall Fingal riſe
   to his aid, and take the ſword of Luno? What then ſhall become of thy fame, ſon of white-boſomed
   Clatho? Turn not thine eves from Fingal, daughter of Iniſtore! I ſhall not quench thy early beam.
   No cloud of mine ſhall riſe, my ſon, upon thy ſoul of fire.” Struggling between concern for the
   fame, and fear for the ſafety of his ſon, be withdraws from the ſight of the engagement, and
   deſpatches Oſſian in haſte to the field,

   injunction: “Father of Oſcar!” addreſſing him by a title which on this occaſion has the higheſt
   propriety: “Father of Oſcar! lift the ſpear, defend the young in arms. But conceal thy ſteps from
   Fillan's eyes. He muſt not know that I doubt his ſteel.” Oſſian arrived too late. But unwilling
   to deſcribe Fillan vanquiſhed, the poet ſuppreſſes all the circumſtances of the combat with
   Cathmor; and only ſhews us the dying hero. We ſee him animated to the end with the ſame martial
   and ardent ſpirit; breathing his laſt in bitter regret for-being ſo early cut off from the field
   of glory. “Oſſian, lay me in that hollow rock. Raiſe no ſtone above me, leſt one ſhould aſk about
   my fame. I am fallen in the firſt of my fields; fallen without renown. Let thy voice alone ſend
   joy to my flying ſoul. Why ſhould the bard know where dwells the early-fallen Fillan?” He who,
   after tracing the circumſtances of this ſtory, ſhall deny that our bard is poſſeſſed of high
   ſentiment and high art, muſt be ſtrangely prejudiced indeed. Let him read the ſtory of Pallas in

I waive inſiſting on any
   more of the particulars in Temora; as my aim is rather to lead the reader into the genius and
   ſpirit of Oſſian's poetry, than to dwell on all his beauties.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> judgment and art diſcovered in conducting works of ſuch length as Fingal
   and Temora, diſtinguiſh them from the other poems in this collection. The ſmaller pieces,
   however, contain particular beauties, no leſs eminent. They are hiſtorical poems, generally of
   the elegiac kind; and plainly diſcover themſelves to be the work of the ſame author. One
   conſiſtent face of manners is everywhere preſented to us; one ſpirit of poetry reigns; the
   maſterly hand of Oſſian appears throughout; the ſame rapid and animated ſtyle; the ſame ſtrong
   colouring of imagination, and the ſame glowing ſenſibility of heart. Beſides the unity which
   belongs to the compoſitions of one man, there is moreover a certain unity of ſubject, which very
   happily connects all theſe poems. They form the poetical hiſtory of the age, of Fingal, The ſame
   race of heroes whom we had met with in the greater poems, Cuthullin, Oſcar, Connar, and Gaul,
   return again upon the ſtage; and Fingal himſelf is always the principal figure, preſented on
   every occaſion, with equal

   laſt. The circumſtances of Oſſian's old age and blindneſs, his ſurviving all his friends, and his
   relating their great exploits to Malvina, the ſpouſe or miſtreſs of his beloved ſon Oſcar,
   furniſh the fineſt poetical ſituations that fancy could deviſe for that tender pathetic which
   reigns in Oſſian's poetry.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">On</span> each of theſe poems there might be room for ſeparate obſervations, with
   regard to he conduct and diſpoſitions of the incidents, as well as to the beauty of the
   deſcriptions and ſentiments. Carthon is a regular and highly finiſhed piece. The main ſtory is
   very properly introduced by Cleſſamore's relation of the adventure of his youth; and this
   introduction is finely heightened by Fingal's ſong of mourning over Moina; in which Oſſian, ever
   fond of doing honour to his father, has contrived to diſtinguiſh him for being an eminent poet,
   as well as warrior. Fingal's ſong upon this occaſion, when “his thouſand bards leaned forwards
   from their ſeats, to hear the voice of the king,” is inferior to no paſſage in the whole book;
   and with great judgement put in his mouth, as the ſeriouſneſs, no leſs than the ſublimity of the
   ſtrain, is peculiarly ſuited to the hero's character. In Darthula are

   can touch the heart of man, friendſhip, love, the affections of parents, ſons, and brothers, the
   diſtreſs of the aged, and the unavailing bravery of the young. The beautiful addreſs to the moon,
   with which the poem opens, and the tranſition from thence to the ſubject, moſt happily prepare
   the mind for that train of affecting events that is to follow. The ſtory is regular, dramatic,
   intereſting to the laſt. He who can read it without emotion may congratulate himſelf, if he
   pleaſes, upon being completely armed againſt ſympathetic ſorrow. As Fingal had no occaſion of
   appearing in the action of this poem, Oſſian makes a very artful tranſition from his narration,
   to what was paſſing in the halls of Selma. The ſound heard there on the ſtrings of his harp, the
   concern which Fingal ſhews on bearing it, and the invocation of the ghoſts of their fathers, to
   receive the heroes falling in a diſtant land, are introduced with great beauty of imagination to
   increaſe the ſolemnity, and to diverſify the ſcenery of the poem.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Carric-thura</span> is full of the moſt ſublime dignity; and has this advantage, of

   ſeems to have been the great delight of Oſſian and the bards of his age. Lathmon is peculiarly
   diſtinguiſhed by high generoſity of ſentiment. This is carried ſo far, particularly in the
   refuſal of Gaul, on one ſide, to take the advantage of a ſleeping foe; and of Lathmon, on the
   other, to overpower by numbers the two young warriors as to recall into one's mind the manners of
   chivalry; ſome reſemblance to which may perhaps be ſuggeſted by other incidents in this
   collection of poems. Chivalry, however, took riſe in an age and country too remote from thoſe of
   Oſſian, to admit the ſuſpicion that the one could have borrowed any thing from the other. So far
   as chivalry had any real exiſtence, the ſame military enthuſiaſm which gave birth to it in the
   feudal times, might, in the days of Oſſian, that is, in the infancy of a riſing ſtate, through
   the operation of the ſame cauſe, very naturally produce effects of the ſame kind on the minds and
   manners of men. So far as chivalry was an ideal ſyſtem, exiſting only in romance, it will not be
   thought ſurpriſing, when we reflect on the account before given of the Celtic bards, that this

   every reader as remarkably judicious and beautiful. We are to be prepared for the death of
   Malvina, which is related in the ſucceeding poem. She is therefore introduced in perſon; “ſhe has
   heard a voice in her dream; She feels the fluttering of her ſoul:” and in a moſt moving
   lamentation addreſſed to her beloved Oſcar, ſhe ſings her own death-ſong. Nothing could be
   calculated with more art to ſooth and comfort her than the ſtory which Oſſian relates. In the
   young and brave Fovargormo, another Oſcar is introduced: his praiſes are ſung; and the happineſs
   is ſet before her of thoſe who die in their youth “when their renown is around them; before the
   feeble behold them in the hall, and ſmile at their trembling hands.”</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> whole train of ideas is admirably ſuited to the ſubject. Every thing is
   full of that inviſible world, into which the aged bard believes himſelf now ready to enter. The
   airy ball of Fingal preſents itſelf to his view; “he ſees the cloud that ſhall receive his ghoſt;
   he beholds the miſt that ſhall form his robe when he appears on his hill;” and all the natural
   objects around him ſeem to carry the preſages of death. “The thiſtle ſhakes its beard to the
   wind. The flower hangs its heavy head; it ſeems to any, I am covered with the drops of heaven;
   the time of my departure is near, and the blaſt that ſhall ſcatter my leaves.” Malvina's death is
   hinted to him in the moſt delicate manner by the ſon of Alpin. His lamentation over her, her
   apotheoſis, or aſcent to the habitation of heroes, and the introduction to the ſtory which
   follows from the mention which Oſſian ſuppoſes the father of Malvina to make of him in the ball
   of Fingal, are all in the higheſt ſpirit of poetry. “And doſt thou remember Oſſian, O Toſcar, ſon
   of Conloch? The battles of our youth were many; our ſwords went together to the field.” Nothing
   could be more proper than to end his ſongs with recording an exploit of the father of that

   his poems.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſcene of moſt of Oſſian's poems is laid in Scotland, or in the coaſt of
   Ireland, oppoſite to the territories of Fingal. When the ſcene is in Ireland, we perceive no
   change of manners from thoſe of Oſſian's native country. For as Ireland was undoubtedly peopled
   with Celtic tribes, the language, cuſtoms, and religion of both nations were the ſame. They had
   been ſeparated from one another by migration, only a few generations, as it ſhould ſeem, before
   our poet's age; and they ſtill maintained a cloſe and frequent intercourſe. But when the poet
   relates the expeditions of any of his heroes to the Scandinavian coaſt, or to the iſlands of
   Orkney, which were then part of the Scandinavian territory, as he does in Carric-thura, Sul-malla
   of Lumon, and Cathloda, the caſe is quite altered. Thoſe countries were inhabited by nations of
   the Teutonic deſcent, who, in their manners and religious rites, differed widely from the Celtæ;
   and it is curious and remarkable, to find this difference clearly pointed out in the poems of
   Oſſian. His deſcriptions bear the native marks of one who was preſent in the expeditions which he
   relates, and who deſcribes what he had ſeen with his own eyes. No ſooner are we carried to
   Lochlin, or

   are in a foreign region. New objects begin to appear. We meet everywhere with the ſtones and
   circles of Loda, that is, Odin, the great Scandinavian deity. We meet with the divinations and
   enchantments for which it is well known thoſe northern nations were early famous. “There, mixed
   with the murmur of waters, roſe the voice of aged men, who called the forms of night to aid them
   in their war;” whilſt the Caledonian chiefs, who aſſiſted them, are deſcribed as ſtanding at a
   diſtance, heedleſs of their rites. That ferocity of manners which diſtinguiſhed thoſe nations,
   alſo becomes conſpicuous. In the combats of their chiefs there is a peculiar ſavageneſs; even
   their women are bloody and fierce. The ſpirit. and the very ideas of Regner Lodbrog, that
   northern ſcalder, whom I formerly quoted, occur to us again. “The hawks,” Oſſian makes one of the
   Scandinavian chiefs ſay, “ruſh from all their winds; they are wont to trace my courſe. We
   rejoiced three days above the dead, and called the hawks of heaven, They came from all their
   winds, to feaſt on the foes of Annir.”</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">A poet</span> of original genius is always diſtinguiſhed by his talent for
   deſcription <a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333648384"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a> A ſecond-rate writer
   diſcerns nothing new or peculiar in the object he means to deſcribe. His conceptions of it are
   vague and looſe; his expreſſions feeble; and of courſe the object is preſented to us
   indiſtinctly, and as through a cloud. But a true poet makes us imagine that we ſee it before our
   eyes; he catches the diſtinguiſhing features; he gives it the colours of life and reality; he
   places it in ſuch a light that a painter could copy after him. This happy talent is chiefly owing
   to a lively imagination, which firſt receives a ſtrong impreſſion of the object; and then, by a
   proper ſelection of capital pictureſque circumſtances employed in deſcribing it, tranſmits that
   impreſſion in its full force to the imaginations of others. That Oſſian poſſeſſes this
   deſcriptive power in a high degree, we have a clear proof, from the effect which his deſcriptions
   produce upon the imaginations of thoſe who read him with any degree of attention, or taſte. Few
   poets are more intereſting. We contract an intimate

The
   characters, the manners, the face of the country, become familiar; we even think we could draw
   the figure of his ghoſt. In a word, whilſt reading him we are tranſported as into a new region,
   and dwell among his objects as if they were all real.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">It</span> were eaſy to point out ſeveral inſtances of exquiſite painting in the
   works of our author. Such, for inſtance, is the ſcenery with which Temora opens, and the attitude
   in which Cairbar is there preſented to us; the deſcription of the young prince Cormac, in the
   ſame book; and the ruins of Balclutha, in Cartho. “I have ſeen the walls of Balclutha, but they
   were deſolate. The fire had reſounded in the balls: and the voice of the people is heard no more.
   The ſtream of Clutha was removed from its place by the fall of the walls. The thiſtle ſhook there

   graſs of the wall waved round his head. Deſolate is the dwelling of Moina; ſilence is in the

   and my tears deſcended with night. Shall I not fight, I ſaid to my ſoul, againſt the children of
   my foes? And I will fight, O bard! I feel the ſtrength of my ſoul.” In the ſame poem, the
   aſſembling of the chiefs round Fingal, who had been warned of ſome impending danger by the
   appearance of a prodigy, is deſcribed with ſo many pictureſque circumſtances, that one imagines
   himſelf preſent in the aſſembly. “The king alone beheld the terrible ſight, and he foreſaw the
   death of his people. He came in ſilence to his hall, and took his father's ſpear: the mail
   rattled on his breaſt. The heroes roſe around. They looked in ſilence on each other, marking the

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">It</span> has been objected to Oſſian, that his deſcriptions of military actions
   are imperfect, and much leſs diverſified by the circumſtances than thoſe of Homer. This is in
   ſome meaſure true. The amazing fertility of Homer's invention, is nowhere ſo much diſplayed as in
   the incidents of his battles, and in the little hiſtory pieces he gives of the perſons ſlain.
   Nor, indeed, with regard to the talent of deſcription, can too much be ſaid in praiſe of Homer.
   Every thing is alive in his writings. The colours with which he paints are thoſe of nature. But
   Oſſian's genius was of a different kind from Homer's. It led him to hurry towards grand objects,
   rather than to amuſe himſelf with particulars of leſs importance. He could dwell on the death of
   a favourite hero; but that of a private man ſeldom ſtopped his rapid courſe. Homer's genius was
   more comprehenſive than Oſſian's. It included a wider circle of objects; and could work up any
   incident into deſcription. Oſſian's was more limited; but the region within which it

   all, the region of the pathetic and the ſublime.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">We</span> muſt not imagine, however, that Oſſian's battles conſiſt only of general
   indiſtinct deſcription. Such beautiful incidents are ſometimes introduced, and the circumſtances
   of the perſons ſlain ſo much diverſified, as ſhow that be could have embelliſhed his military
   ſcenes with an abundant variety of particulars, if his genius had led him to dwell upon them.
   “One man is ſtretched in the duſt of his native land; he fell, where often he had ſpread the
   feaſt, and often raiſed the voice of the harp.” The maid of Iniſtore is introduced in a moving
   apoſtrophe, as weeping for another; and a third, “as rolled in the duſt he lifted his faint eyes
   to the king,” is remembered and mourned by Fingal as the friend of Agandecca. The blood pouring
   from the wound of one who was ſlain by night, is heard “hiſſing on the half-extinguiſhed oak,”
   which had been kindled for giving light. Another climbing up a tree to eſcape from his foe, is
   pierced by his ſpear from behind; ſhrieking, panting he fell; whilſt moſs and withered branches

   Gaul in his armour, and my ſoul was mixed with his; for the fire of the battle was in his eyes,
   lie looked to the foe with joy. We ſpoke the words of friendſhip in ſecret; and the lightning of
   our ſwords poured together. We drew them behind the wood, and tried the ſtrength of our arms on
   the empty air.`</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Oſſian</span> is always conciſe in his deſcriptions, which adds much to their
   beauty and force. For it is a great miſtake to imagine, that a crowd of particulars, or a very
   fall and extended ſtyle, is of advantage to deſcription. On the contrary, ſuch a diffuſe manner
   for the moſt part weakens it. Any one redundant circumſtance is a nuiſance. It encumbers and
   loads the fancy, and renders the main image indiſtinct. “Obſtat,” as Quintilian ſays with regard
   to ſtyle, “quicquid non adjuvat.” To be conciſe in deſcription, is one thing: and to be general,
   is another. No deſcription that reſts in generals can poſſibly be good; it can convey no lively
   idea; for it is of particulars only that we have a diſtinct conception. But, at the ſame time, no
   ſtrong imagination dwells long upon any one particular; or heaps together a maſs of trivial ones.

   one glance than a feeble imagination is able to do, by turning its object round and round into a
   variety of lights. Tacitus is of all proſe writers the moſt conciſe. He has even a degree of
   abruptneſs reſembling our author: yet no writer is more eminent for lively deſcription. When
   Fingal, after having conquered the haughty Swaran, propoſes to diſmiſs him with honour: “Raiſe
   to-morrow thy white ſails to the wind, thou brother of Agandecca!” he conveys, by thus addreſſing
   his enemy, a ſtronger impreſſion of the emotions then paſſing within his mind, than if whole
   paragraphs had been ſpent in deſcribing the conflict between reſentment againſt Swaran and the
   tender remembrance of his ancient love. No amplification is needed to give us the moſt full idea
   of a hardy veteran, after the few following words: “His ſhield is marked with the ſtrokes of
   battle; his red eye deſpiſes danger.” When Oſcar left alone, was ſurrounded by foes, “he ſtood,”
   it is ſaid, “growing in his place, like the flood of the narrow vale;” a happy repreſentation of
   one, who, by daring intrepidity in the midſt of danger, ſeems to increaſe in his appearance, and
   becomes more formidable every moment, like the ſudden riſing of the torrent hemmed in

And a whole crowd of ideas,
   concerning the circumſtances of domeſtic ſorrow, occaſioned by a young warrior's firſt going
   forth to battle, is poured upon the mind by theſe words: “Calmar leaned on his father's ſpear;
   that ſpear which he brought from Lara's hall, when the ſoul of his mother was ſad.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> conciſeneſs of Oſſian's deſcriptions is the more proper, on account of
   his ſubjects. Deſcriptions of gay and ſmiling ſcenes may, without any diſadvantage, be amplified
   and prolonged. Force is not the predominant quality expected in theſe. The deſcription may be
   weakened by being diffuſe, yet, notwithſtanding, may be beautiful ſtill; whereas, with reſpect to
   grand, ſolemn, and pathetic ſubjects, which are Oſſian's chief field, the caſe is very different.
   In theſe, energy is above all things required. The imagination muſt be ſeized at once, or not at
   all; and is far more deeply impreſſed by one ſtrong and ardent image, than by the anxious
   minuteneſs of labored illuſtration.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> Oſſian's genius, though chiefly turned towards the ſublime and pathetic,
   was not confined to it. In ſubjects alſo of grace and delicacy, he diſcovers the hand of a
   maſter. Take for an example the following elegant deſcription of Agandecca, wherein the

   “The daughter of the ſnow overheard, and left the hall of her ſecret ſigh. She came in all her

   ſoul. Her blue eyes rolled on him in ſecret; and ſhe bleſt the chief of Morven.” Several other
   inſtances might be produced of the feelings of love and friendſhip, painted by our author with a
   moſt natural and happy delicacy.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſimplicity of Oſſian's manner adds great beauty to his deſcriptions, and

   to be prompted by his feelings; and to ſpeak from the abundance of his heart. I remember no more

   Odyſſey, when Ulyſſes meets his mother in the ſhades. On both theſe occaſions, the heroes, melted
   with tenderneſs, lament their not having it in their power to throw their arms round the ghoſt,

   for it is a natural and juſt expreſſion; and conveys a clear idea of that gratification which a
   virtuous heart often feels in the indulgence of a tender melancholy. Oſſian makes a very proper
   diſtinction between this gratification and the deſtructive effect of overpowering grief. “There
   is a joy in grief when peace dwells in the breaſts of the ſad. But ſorrow waſtes the mournful, O
   daughter of Toſcar, and their days are few.” To “give the joy of grief,” generally ſignifies to

   and finely characterizes the taſte of Oſſian's age and country. In thoſe days, when the ſongs of
   bards were the great delight of heroes, the tragic muſe was hold in chief honour: gallant actions
   and virtuous ſufferings, were the choſen theme; preferably to that light and trifling ſtrain, of
   poetry and muſic, which promotes light and trifling manners, and ſerves to emaſculate the mind.
   “Strike the harp in my hall,” ſaid the great Fingal, in the midſt of youth and victory; “ſtrike
   the harp in my hall, and let Fingal hear the ſong. Pleaſant is the joy of grief! It is like the

  <p class="noindent">A poetical<span class="sc"/> ſimile always ſuppoſes two objects brought together, between which
   there is ſome near relation or connection in the fancy. What that relation ought to be, cannot be
   preciſely defined. For various, almoſt numberleſs, are the analogies formed among objects, by a
   ſprightly imagination. The relation of actual ſimilitude, or likeneſs of appearance, is far from
   being the only foundation of poetical compariſon. Sometimes a reſemblance in the effect produced
   by two objects, is made the connecting principle: ſometimes a reſemblance in one diſtinguiſhing
   property or circumſtance. Very often two objects are brought together in a ſimile, though they
   reſemble one another, ſtrictly ſpeaking, in nothing, only becauſe they raiſe in the mind a train
   of ſimilar, and what may be called concordant, ideas; ſo that the remembrance of the one, when
   recalled, ſerves to quicken and heighten the impreſſion made by the other. Thus, to give an

   looks back on the exploits of his youth, has certainly no direct reſemblance to the beauty of a
   fine evening; further than that both agree in producing a certain calm, placid joy. Yet Oſſian
   has founded upon this, one of the moſt beautiful compariſons that is to be met with in any poet.
   “Wilt thou not liſten, ſon of the rock, to the ſong of Oſſian? My ſoul is full of other times;
   the joy of my youth returns. Thus the ſun appears in the weſt, after the ſteps of his brightneſs
   have moved behind a ſtorm. The green hills lift their dewy heads. The blue ſtreams rejoice in the
   vale. The aged hero comes forth on his ſtaff; and his gray hair glitters in the beam.” Never was
   there a finer group of objects. It raiſes a ſtrong conception of the old man's joy and elation of
   heart, by diſplaying a ſcene which produces in every ſpectator a correſponding train of pleaſing
   emotions; the declining ſun looking forth in his brightneſs after a ſtorm; the cheerful face of
   all nature; and the ſtill life finely animated by the circumſtance of the aged hero, with his
   ſtaff and his gray locks: a circumſtance both extremely pictureſque, in itſelf, and peculiarly
   ſuited to the main object of the compariſon. Such analogies and aſſociations of ideas as theſe,
   are highly pleaſing to the fancy. They give

   objects, and remarking the differences among thoſe which ſeem alike, ſo the higheſt amuſement of
   the imagination is to trace likeneſſes and agreements among thoſe which ſeem different.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> principal rules which reſpect poetical compariſons are, that they be

   which he ſees around him, and which have often ſtruck his fancy. For this reaſon, In order to
   judge of the propriety of poetical imagery, we ought to be in ſome meaſure acquainted with the
   natural hiſtory of the country where the ſcene of the poem is laid. The introduction of foreign
   images betrays a poet, copying not from nature, but from other writers. Hence ſo many lions, and
   tigers, and eagles, and ſerpents, which we meet, with in the ſimiles of modern poets; as if theſe
   animals had acquired ſome right to a place in poetical compariſons for ever, becauſe employed by
   ancient authors. They employed them with propriety, as objects generally known in their, country,
   but they are abſurdly uſed for illuſtration by us, who know them only at ſecond hand, or by
   deſcription. To moſt readers of modern poetry, it were more to the purpoſe to deſcribe lions or
   tigers by ſimiles taken from men, than to compare men to lions. Oſſian is very correct in this
   particular. His imagery is, without exception, copied from that face of nature which be ſaw
   before his eyes; and by conſequence may be expected to be lively. We meet with no Grecian or
   Italian ſcenery; but with the miſts and clouds, and ſtorms, of a northern mountainous region.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">No</span> poet abounds more in ſimiles than Oſſian. There are in this collection as
   many, at leaſt, as in the whole Iliad and Odyſſey of Homer. I am indeed inclined to think, that
   the works of both poets are too much crowded with them. Similes are ſparkling ornaments; and,
   like all things that ſparkle, are apt to dazzle and tire us by their luſtre. But if Oſſian's
   ſimiles be too frequent, they have this advantage, of being commonly ſhorter than Homer's; they
   interrupt his narration leſs; he juſt glances aſide to ſome reſembling, object, and inſtantly
   returns to his former track. Homer's ſimiles include a wider range of objects; but, in return,
   Oſſian's, are, without exception, taken from objects of dignity, which cannot be ſaid for all
   thoſe which Homer employs. The ſun, the moon, and the ſtars, clouds and meteors, lightning and
   thunder, ſeas and whales, rivers, torrents, winds, ice, rain, ſnow, dews, miſt, fire and ſmoke,
   trees and foreſts, heath and graſs and flowers, rocks and mountains, muſic and ſongs, light and
   darkneſs, ſpirits and ghoſts; theſe form the circle within which Oſſian's compariſons generally
   run. Some, not many, are taken from birds and beaſts: as eagles, ſea-fowl, the horſe, the deer,
   and the mountain bee; and a very few from ſuch operations of art as were then known.

   more alluſions to the animal world; to lions, bulls, goats, herds of cattle, ſerpents, inſects;
   and to various occupations of rural and paſtoral life. Oſſian's defect in this article, is
   plainly owing to the deſert, uncultivated ſtate of his country, which ſuggeſted to him few images
   beyond natural inanimate objects, in their rudeſt form. The birds and animals of the country were
   probably not numerous; and his acquaintance with them was ſlender, as they were little ſubjected
   to the uſes of man.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> great objection made to Oſſian's imagery, is its uniformity, and the too
   frequent repetition of the ſame compariſon. In a work ſo thick-ſown with ſimiles one could not
   but expect to find images of the ſame kind ſometimes ſuggeſted to the poet by reſembling objects;
   eſpecially to a poet like Oſſian, who wrote from the immediate impulſe of poetical enthuſiaſm,
   and without much preparation of ſtudy or labor. Fertile as Homer's imagination is acknowledged to
   be, who does not know how often his lions, and bulls, and flocks of ſheep, recur with little or
   no variation; nay, ſometimes, in the very ſame words? The objection made to Oſſian is, however,
   founded, in a great meaſure, upon a miſtake. It has been ſuppoſed

   moon, the cloud, or the thunder, returns in a ſimile, it is the ſame ſimile, and the ſame moon,
   or cloud, or thunder, which they had met with a few pages before. Whereas very often the ſimiles
   are widely different. The object, from whence they are taken, is indeed in ſubſtance the ſame;
   but the image is new; for the appearance of the object is changed; it is preſented to the fancy
   in another attitude: and clothed with new circumſtances, to make it ſuit the different
   illuſtration for which it is employed. In this lies Oſſian's great art; in ſo happily varying the
   form of the few natural appearances with which he was acquainted, as to make them correſpond to a
   great many different objects.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Let</span> us take for one inſtance the moon, which is very frequently introduced
   in his compariſons; as in northern climates, where the nights are long, the moon is a greater
   object of attention than in the climate of Homer; and let us view how much our poet has
   diverſified its appearance. The ſhield of it warrior is like “the darkened moon when it moves a
   dun circle through the heavens.” The face of a ghoſt, wan and ale, is like “the beam of the
   ſetting moon.” And a different appearance of a ghoſt, thin and indiſtinct, is like “the

   when the ſky pours down its flaky ſnow, and the world is ſilent and dark;” or, in a different
   form ſtill, is like “the watery beam of the moon, when it ruſhes from between two clouds, and the
   midnight ſhower is on the field.” A very oppoſite uſe is made of the moon in the deſcription of
   Agandecca: “She came in all her beauty, like the moon from the cloud of the eaſt.” Hope ſucceeded
   by diſappointment, is “joy riſing on her face and ſorrow returning again, like a thin cloud on
   the moon.” But when Swaran, after his defeat, is cheered by Fingal's generoſity, “his face
   brightened like the full moon of heaven, when the clouds vaniſh away, and leave her calm and
   broad in the midſt of the ſky.” Venvela is “bright as the moon when it trembles o'er the weſtern
   wave;” but the ſoul of the guilty Uthal is “dark as the troubled face of the moon, when it
   foretells the ſtorm.” And by a very fanciful and uncommon alluſion, it is ſaid of Cormac, who was
   to die in his early years, “Nor long ſhalt thou lift the ſpear, mildly-ſhining beam of youth!
   Death ſtands dim behind thee, like the darkened half of the moon behind its growing light.”</p>

   a very familiar appearance in the country of Oſſian, he applies to a variety of purpoſes, and
   purſues through a great many forms. Sometimes, which one would hardly expect, he employs it to
   heighten the appearance of a beautiful object. The hair of Morna is “like the miſt of Cromla,
   when it curls on the rock, and ſhines to the beam of the weſt.” “The ſong comes with its muſic to
   melt and pleaſe the ear. It is like ſoft miſt, that riſing from the lake pours on the ſilent

   dim.”—“The darkneſs of old age comes like the miſt of the deſert.” The face of a ghoſt is “pale
   as the miſt of Cromla.”—“The gloom of battle is rolled along as miſt that is poured on the
   valley, when ſtorms invade the ſilent ſunſhine of heaven.” Fame, ſuddenly departing, is likened
   to “miſt that flies away before the ruſtling wind of the vale.” A ghoſt, ſlowly vaniſhing, to
   “miſt that melts by degrees on the ſunny hill.” Cairbar, after his treacherous aſſaſſination of
   Oſcar, is compared to a peſtilential fog. “I love a foe like Cathmor,” ſays Fingal, “his ſoul is
   great; his arm is ſtrong; his battles are full of fame. But the little ſoul is like a vapor that
   hovers round the marſhy lake. It never riſes on the green hill, leſt the winds meet it there. Its
   dwelling is in the cave; and it ſends forth the dart of death.” This is a ſimile highly finiſhed.
   But there is another which is ſtill more ſtriking, founded alſo on miſt, in the fourth book of
   Temora. Two factious chiefs are contending: Cathmor, the king, interpoſes, rebukes, and ſilences
   them. The poet intends to give us the higheſt idea of Cathmor's ſuperiority; and moſt effectually
   accompliſhes his intention by the following happy image. “They ſunk

   columns of morning miſt, when the ſun riſes between them on his glittering rocks. Dark is their
   rolling on either ſide; each towards its reedy pool.” Theſe inſtances may ſufficiently ſhow with
   what richneſs of imagination Oſſian's compariſons abound, and, at the ſame time, with what
   propriety of judgment they are employed. If his field was narrow, it muſt be admitted to have
   been as well cultivated as its extent would allow.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">As</span> it is uſual to judge of poets from a compariſon of their ſimiles more
   than of other paſſages, it will, perhaps, be agreeable to the reader, to ſee how Homer and Oſſian
   have conducted ſome images of the ſame kind. This might be ſhown in many inſtances. For as the
   great objects of nature are common to the poets of all nations, and make the general ſtorehouſe
   of all imagery, the groundwork of their compariſons muſt, of courſe, be Frequently the ſame. I
   ſhall ſelect only a few of the moſt conſiderable from both poets. Mr. Pope's tranſlation of Homer
   can be of no uſe to us here. The parallel is altogether unfair between proſe and the impoſing
   harmony of flowing numbers. It is only by viewing Homer in the ſimplicity of a

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> ſhock of two encountering armies, the noiſe and the tumult of battle,
   afford one of the moſt grand and awful ſubjects of deſcription; on which all epic poets have
   exerted their ſtrength. Let us firſt hear Homer. The following deſcription is a favourite one,
   for we find it twice repeated in the ſame words<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333554592"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>. “When now the conflicting hoſts joined in the
   field of battle, then were mutually oppoſed ſhields, and ſwords, and the ſtrength of armed men.
   The boſſy bucklers were daſhed againſt each other. The univerſal tumult roſe. There were mingled
   the triumphant ſhouts and the dying groans of the victors and the vanquiſhed. The earth ſtreamed
   with blood. As when winter torrents, ruſhing from the mountains, pour into a narrow valley their
   violent waters. They iſſue from a thouſand ſprings, and mix in the hollowed channel. The diſtant
   ſhepherd hears on the mountain their roar from afar. Such was the terror and the ſhout of the
   engaging armies.” In another paſſage, the poet, much in the manner of Oſſian, heaps ſimile on
   ſimile, to expreſs the vaſtneſs of

   labor. “With a mighty ſhout the hoſts engage. Not ſo loud roars the wave of ocean, when driven
   againſt the ſhore by the whole force of the boiſterous north; not ſo loud in the woods of the
   mountain, the noiſe of the flame, when riſing in its fury to conſume the foreſt; not ſo loud the
   wind among the lofty oaks, when the wrath of the worm rages; as was the clamor of the Greeks and
   Trojans, when, roaring terrible, they ruſhed againſt each other.”<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333550128"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a> </p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">To</span> theſe deſcriptions and ſimiles, we may oppoſe the following from Oſſian,
   and leave the reader to judge between them. He will find images of the ſame kind employed;
   commonly leſs extended; but thrown forth with a glowing rapidity which characterizes our poet.
   “As autumn's dark ſtorms pour from two echoing hills, towards each other approached the heroes.
   As two dark ſtreams from high rocks meet and mix, and roar on the plains; loud, rough, and dark
   in battle, meet Lochlin and Iniſfail. Chief mixed his ſtrokes with chief, and man with man. Steel
   clanging, ſounded on ſteel. Helmets are cleft on high; blood

   noiſe of the ocean, when roll the waves on high; as the laſt peal of the thunder of heaven; ſuch
   is the noiſe of battle.” “As roll a thouſand waves to the rock, ſo Swaran's beſt came on; as
   meets a rock a thouſand waves, ſo Iniſfail met Swaran. Death raiſes all his voices around, and
   mixes with the ſound of ſhields.—The field echoes from wing to wing, as a hundred hammers that
   riſe by turns on the red ſon of the furnace.”—“As a hundred winds on Morven; as the ſtreams of a
   hundred hills; as clouds fly ſucceſſive over heaven or as the dark ocean aſſaults the ſhore of
   the deſert ſo roaring, ſo vaſt, ſo terrible, the armies mixed on Lena's echoing heath.” In
   ſeveral of theſe images there is a remarkable ſimilarity to Homer's: but what follows is ſuperior
   to any compariſon that Homer uſes on this ſubject. “The groan of the people ſpread over the
   hills; it was like the thunder of night, when the cloud burſts on Cona, and a thouſand ghoſts
   ſhriek at once on the hollow wind.” Never was an image of, more awful ſublimity employed to
   heighten the terror of battle.</p>

   “beholds from the rock a cloud borne along the ſea by the weſtern wind; black as pitch it appears
   from afar ſailing over the ocean, and carrying the dreadful ſtorm. He ſhrinks at the ſight, and
   drives his flock into the cave: ſuch, under the Ajaces, moved on the dark, the thickened phalanx
   to the war.”<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333541376"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a> —“They came,” ſays Oſſian, “over the deſert like ſtormy clouds,
   when the winds roll them over the heath; their edges are tinged with lightning; and the echoing
   groves foreſee the ſtorm.” The edges of the clouds tinged with lightning, is a ſublime idea: but
   the ſhepherd and his flock render Homer's ſimile more pictureſque. This is frequently the
   difference between the two poets. Oſſian gives no more than the main image, ſtrong and full:
   Homer adds circumſtances and appendages, which amuſe the fancy by enlivening the ſcenery.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Homer</span> compares the regular appearance of an army, to “clouds that are
   ſettled on the mountain-top, in the day of calmneſs, when the ſtrength of the north wind
   ſleeps<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333538352"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>.” Oſſian, with full as much propriety, compares the appearance of a
   diſordered army, to “the
   <span class="page-number-image-wrapper"><span class="page-break">

   its womb, and ſcatters the curling gloom on every ſide.” Oſſian's clouds aſſume a great many
   forms, and, as we might expect from his climate, are a fertile ſource of imagery to him. “The
   warriors followed their chiefs like the gathering of the rainy clouds behind the red meteors of
   heaven.” An army retreating without coming to action, is likened to “clouds, that having long
   threatened rain, retire ſlowly behind the hills.” The picture of Oithona, after ſhe had
   determined to die, is lively and delicate. “Her ſoul was reſolved, and the tear was dried from
   her wildly-looking eye. A troubled joy roſe on her mind, like the red path of the lightning on a
   ſtormy cloud.” The image alſo of the gloomy Cairbar, meditating, in ſilence, the aſſaſſination of
   Oſcar, until the moment came when his deſigns were ripe for execution, is extremely noble and
   complete in all its parts. “Cairbar heard their words in ſilence, like the cloud of a ſhower; it
   ſtands dark on Cromla till the lightning burſts its ſide. The valley gleams with red light; the
   ſpirits of the ſtorm rejoice. So ſtood the ſilent king of Temora; at length his words are
   heard.”</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Homer's</span> compariſon of Achilles to the Dog-Star, is very ſublime. “Priam
   beheld him ruſhing along the plain, ſhining in his armour, like the ſtar of autumn bright are its
   beams, diſtinguiſhed amidſt the multitude of ſtars in the dark hour of night. It riſes in its
   ſplendor; but its ſplendor is fatal; betokening to miſerable men the deſtroying heat<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333530880"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>.” The firſt appearance of Fingal is, in like manner, compared by
   Oſſian to a ſtar or meteor. “Fingal, tall in his ſhip, ſtretched his bright lance before him.
   Terrible was the gleam of his ſteel; it was like the green meteor of death, ſetting in the heath
   of Malmor, when the traveller is alone, and the broad moon is darkened in heaven.” The hero's
   appearance in Homer is more magnificent; in Oſſian, more terrible.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">A tree</span> cut down, or overthrown by a ſtorm, is a ſimilitude frequent among
   poets for deſcribing the fall of a warrior in battle. Homer employs it often. But the moſt
   beautiful, by far, of his compariſons, founded on this object, indeed one of the moſt beautiful
   in the whole Iliad, is that on the death of Euphorbus. “As the young and verdant olive, which a
   man hath reared with care in a lonely field, where

   fair and flouriſhing; it is fanned by the breath of all the winds, and loaded with white
   bloſſoms; when the ſudden blaſt of a whirlwind deſcending, roots it out from its bed, and
   ſtretches it on the duſt <a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333526048"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>.” To this, elegant as it is, we may oppoſe the following ſimile of
   Oſſian's, relating to the death of the three ſons of Uſnoth. “They fell, like three young oaks
   which ſtood alone on the hill. The traveller ſaw the lovely trees, and wondered how they grew ſo
   lonely. The blaſt of the deſert came by night, and laid their green heads low. Next day he
   returned; but they were withered, and the heath was bare.” Malvina's alluſion to the ſame object,
   in her lamentation over Oſcar, is ſo exquiſitely tender, that I cannot forbear giving it a place
   alſo. “I was a lovely tree in thy preſence, Oſcar! with all my branches round me. But thy death
   came, like a blaſt from the deſert, and laid my green head low. The ſpring returned with its
   ſhowers; but no leaf of mine aroſe.” Several of Oſſian's ſimiles, taken from trees, are
   remarkably beautiful, and diverſified with well-choſen circumſtances ſuch as that upon the death
   of Ryno and Orla: They have fallen

   acroſs a ſtream, and withers in the wind of the mountains.” Or that which Oſſian applies to
   himſelf: “I, like an ancient oak in Morven, moulder alone in my place; the blaſt hath lopped my
   branches away; and I tremble at the winds of the north.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">As</span> Homer exalts his heroes by comparing them to gods, Oſſian makes the ſame
   uſe of compariſons taken from ſpirits and ghoſts. “Swaran roared in battle, like the ſhrill
   ſpirit of a ſtorm, that ſits dim on the clouds of Gormal, and enjoys the death of the mariner.”
   His people gathered round Erragon, “like ſtorms around the ghoſt of night, when he calls them
   from the top of Morven, and prepares to pour them on the land of the ſtranger.”—“They fell before
   my ſon like groves in the deſert, when an angry ghoſt ruſhes through night, and takes their green
   heads in his hand.” In ſuch images, Oſſian appears in his ſtrength; for very ſeldom have
   ſupernatural beings been painted with ſo much ſublimity, and ſuch force of imagination, as by
   this poet. Even Homer, great as he is, muſt yield to him in ſimiles formed upon theſe. Take, for
   inſtance, the following, which is the moſt remarkable of this kind in the Iliad.

   Mars, the deſtroyer of men, when lie ruſhes to war. Terror, his beloved ſon, ſtrong and fierce,
   attends him; who fills with diſmay the moſt valiant hero. They come from Thrace armed againſt the
   Ephyrians and Phlegyans; nor do they regard the prayers of either, but diſpoſe of ſucceſs at
   their will<a class="toggle-note" href="#note_idm45753333517024"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"><span class="sr-only">Display note</span></i></a>.” The idea here is undoubtedly noble, but obſerve what a figure
   Oſſian ſets before the aſtoniſhed imagination, and with what ſublimely terrible circumſtances he
   has heightened it. “He ruſhed, in the ſound of his arms, like the dreadful ſpirit of Loda, when
   he comes in the roar of a thouſand ſtorms, and ſcatters battles from his eyes. He ſits on a cloud
   over Lochlin's ſeas. His mighty hand is on his ſword. The wind lifts his flaming locks. So
   terrible was Cuthullin in the day of his fame.”</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Homer's</span> compariſons relate chiefly to martial ſubjects, to the appearances
   and motions of armies, the engagement and death of heroes, and the various incidents of war. In
   Oſſian, we find a greater variety of other ſubjects, illuſtrated by ſimiles, particularly the
   ſongs of bards, the beauty of women, the different circumſtances of
   <span class="page-number-image-wrapper"><span class="page-break">

   give occaſion to much beautiful imagery. What, for inſtance, can be more delicate and moving,
   than the following ſimile of Oithona's, in her lamentation over the diſhonour ſhe had ſuffered
   “Chief of Strumon.” replied the ſighing maid, why didſt thou come over the dark blue wave to
   Nuath's mournful daughter? Why did not I paſs away in ſecret, like the flower of the rock, that
   lifts its fair head unſeen, and ſtrews its withered leaves on the blaſt?” The muſic of bards, a
   favourite object with Oſſian, is illuſtrated by a variety of the moſt beautiful appearances that
   are to be found in nature. It is compared to the calm ſhower of ſpring; to the dews of the
   morning on the hill of roes; to the face of the blue and ſtill lake. Two ſimiles on this ſubject
   I ſhall quote, becauſe they would do honour to any of the moſt celebrated claſſics. The one is:
   “Sit thou on the heath, O bard! and let us hear thy voice; it is pleaſant as the gale of the
   ſpring that ſighs on the hunter's ear, when he awakens from dreams of joy, and has heard the
   muſic of the ſpirits of the hill.” The other contains a ſhort but exquiſitely tender image,
   accompanied with the fineſt poetical painting. “The muſic of Carril was like the memory of joys
   that are paſt,

The
   ghoſts of departed bards heard it from Slimora's ſide. Soft ſounds ſpread along the wood; and the
   ſilent valleys of night rejoice.” What a figure would ſuch imagery and ſuch ſcenery have made,
   had they been preſented to us adorned with the ſweetneſs and harmony of the Virgilian
   numbers!</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">I have</span> choſen all along to compare Oſſian with Homer, rather than Virgil,
   for an obvious reaſon. There is a much nearer correſpondence between the times and manners of the
   two former poets. Both wrote in an early period of ſociety; both are originals; both are
   diſtinguiſhed by ſimplicity, ſublimity, and fire. The correct elegances of Virgil, his artful
   imitation of Homer, the Roman ſtatelineſs which he everywhere maintains, admit no parallel with
   the abrupt boldneſs and enthuſiaſtic warmth of the Celtic bard. In one article, indeed, there is
   a reſemblance. Virgil is more tender than Homer, and thereby agrees more with Oſſian; with this
   difference, that the feelings of the one are more gentle and poliſhed—thoſe of the other more
   ſtrong: the tenderneſs of Virgil ſoftenſ—that of Oſſian diſſolves and overcomes the heart.</p>

   and climate altogether different from thoſe of Oſſian: a warmer country, a more ſmiling face of
   nature, the arts of agriculture and of rural life much farther advanced. The wine-preſs and the
   threſhing-floor are often preſented to us; the cedar and the palm-tree, the fragrance of perfumes
   the voice of the turtle, and the beds of lilies. The ſimiles are, like Oſſian's, generally ſhort,
   touching on one point of reſemblance, rather than ſpread out into little epiſodes. In the
   following example may be perceived what inexpreſſible grandeur poetry receives from the
   intervention of the Deity. “The nations ſhall ruſh like the ruſhing of many waters; but God ſhall
   rebuke them, and they ſhall fly far off, and ſhall be chaſed as the chaff of the “mountains

   ſuppreſſes the mark of compariſon, and ſubſtitutes a figured deſcription in room of the object
   deſcribed, is a great enlivener of ſtyle. It denotes that glow and rapidity of fancy, which,
   without pauſing to form a regular ſimile, paints the object at one ſtroke. “Thou art to me the
   beam of the caſt, riſing in a land unknown.”—“In peace, thou art the gale of ſpring; In war, the
   mountain ſtorm.”—“Pleaſant be thy reſt, O lovely beam! ſoon haſt thou ſet on our hills! The ſteps
   of thy departure were ſtately, like the moon on the blue trembling wave. But thou haſt left us in
   darkneſs, firſt of the maids of Lutha!—Soon haſt thou ſet, Malvina! but thou riſeſt, like the
   beam of the eaſt, among the ſpirits of thy friends, where they ſit in their ſtormy halls, the
   chambers of the thunder.” This is correct, and finely ſupported. But in the following inſtance,
   the metaphor, though very beautiful at the beginning, becomes imperfect before it cloſes, by
   being improperly mixed with the literal ſenſe. “Trathal went forth with the ſtream of his people:

   Oſſian; as the undiſciplined imagination of early ages generally prompts exaggeration, and
   carries its objects to exceſs; whereas longer experience, and farther progreſs in the arts of
   life, chaſten men's ideas and expreſſions. Yet Oſſian's hyperboles appear not, to me, either ſo
   frequent or ſo harſh as might at firſt have been looked for; an advantage owing, no doubt, to the
   more cultivated ſtate in which, as was before ſhown, poetry ſubſiſted among the ancient Celtæ,
   than among moſt other barbarous nations. One of the moſt exaggerated deſcriptions in the whole
   work, is what meets us at the beginning of Fingal, where the ſcout makes his report to Cuthullin
   of the landing of the foe. But this is ſo far from deſerving cenſure, that it merits praiſe, as
   being on that occaſion natural and proper. The ſcout arrives, trembling and full of fears; and it
   is well known that no paſſion diſpoſes men to hyperbolize more than terror. It both annihilates
   themſelves in their own apprehenſion, and magnifies every object which they view through the
   medium of a troubled imagination. Hence all thoſe indiſtinct images of formidable

   The beauties of each are too great and too obvious to need any particular comment. In one paſſage
   only of the addreſs to the moon, there appears ſome obſcurity. “Whither doſt thou retire from thy
   courſe when the darkneſs of they countenance grows? Haſt thou thy hall like Oſſian? Dwelleſt thou
   in the ſhadow of grief? Have thy ſiſters fallen from heaven? Are they who rejoiced with thee, at
   night, no more? Yes, they have fallen, fair light! and thou doſt often retire to mourn.” We may
   be at a loſs to comprehend, at firſt view, the ground of thoſe ſpeculations of Oſſian concerning

   the preſent ſituation of his mind.

   paſſion, tinctures with its own diſpoſition every object which it beholds. The old bard, with his
   heart bleeding for the loſs of all his friends, is meditating on the different phaſes of the
   moon. Her waning and darkneſs preſent to his melancholy imagination the image of ſorrow; and
   preſently the idea ariſes, and is indulged, that like himſelf, ſhe retires to mourn over the loſs
   of other moons, or of ſtars, whom he calls her ſiſters, and fancies to have once rejoiced with
   her at night, now fallen from heaven. Darkneſs ſuggeſted the idea of mourning, and mourning
   ſuggeſted nothing ſo naturally to Oſſian as the death of beloved friends. An inſtance preciſely
   ſimilar, of this influence of paſſion, may be ſeen in a paſſage, which has always been admired,
   of Shakſpeare's King Lear. The old man, on the point of diſtraction through the inhumanity of his

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Having</span> now treated fully of Oſſian's talents, with reſpect to deſcription
   and imagery, it only remains to make ſome obſervations on his ſentiments. No ſentiments can be
   beautiful without being proper; that is, ſuited to the character and ſituation of thoſe who utter
   them. In this reſpect Oſſian is as correct as moſt writers. His characters, as above deſcribed,
   are, in general, well ſupported; which could not have been the caſe, had the ſentiments been
   unnatural or out of place. A variety of perſonages, of different ages, ſexes, and conditions, are
   introduced into his poems; and they ſpeak and act with a propriety of ſentiment and behavior
   which it is ſurpriſing to find in ſo rude an age. Let the poem of Dar-thula, throughout, be taken

   is the higheſt effect either of eloquence or poetry; and, to produce this effect, requires a
   genius glowing with the ſtrongeſt and warmeſt conception of ſome object, awful, great, or
   magnificent. That this character of genius belongs to Oſſian, may, I think, ſufficiently appear
   from many of the paſſages I have already had occaſion to quote. To produce more inſtances were
   ſuperfluous. If the engagement of Fingal with the ſpirit of Loda, in Carric-thura; if the
   encounters of the armies, in Fingal; if the addreſs to the ſun, in Carthon; if the ſimiles
   founded upon ghoſts and ſpirits of the night, all formerly mentioned, be not admitted as

   out this ſentiment, or deſcription, and to deck it round and round with glittering ornaments,
   than the mind begins to fall from its high elevation; the tranſport is over; the beautiful may
   remain, but the ſublime is gone. Hence the conciſe and ſimple ſtyle of Oſſian gives great

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Sublimity</span>, as belonging to ſentiment, coincides, in a great meaſure, with
   magnanimity, heroiſm, and generoſity of ſentiment. Whatever diſcovers human nature in its
   greateſt elevation; whatever beſpeaks a high effort of ſoul, or ſhews a mind ſuperior to
   pleaſures, to dangers, and to death, forms what may be called the moral of ſentimental ſublime.
   For this Oſſian is eminently diſtinguiſhed. No poet maintains a higher tone of virtuous and noble
   ſentiment throughout all his works. Particularly in all the ſentiments of Fingal there is a
   grandeur and loftineſs, proper to ſwell the mind with the higheſt ideas of human perfection.
   Wherever he appears, we behold the hero. The objects which he purſues are always truly great: to
   bend the proud; to protect the injured; to defend his friends; to overcome his enemies by
   generoſity more than by force. A portion of the ſame ſpirit actuates all the other heroes. Valor
   reigns; but it is a generous valor, void of cruelty, animated by honour, not by hatred. We behold

   avarice or of inſult; but a perpetual contention for fame; a deſire of being diſtinguiſhed and
   remembered for gallant actions; a love of juſtice; and a zealous attachment to their friends and
   their country. Such is the ſtrain of ſentiment in the works of Oſſian.</p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">But</span> the ſublimity of moral ſentiments, if they wanted the ſoftening of the
   tender, would be in hazard of giving a hard and ſtiff air to poetry. It is not enough to admire.
   Admiration is a cold feeling, in compariſon of that deep intereſt which the heart takes in tender
   and pathetic ſcenes; where, by a myſterious attachment to the objects of compaſſion, we are
   pleaſed and delighted, even whilſt we mourn. With ſcenes of this kind Oſſian abounds; and his
   high merit in theſe is inconteſtible. He may be blamed for drawing tears too often from our eyes;
   but that he has the power of commanding them, I believe no man, who as the leaſt ſenſibility,
   will queſtion. The general character of his poetry is the heroic mixed with the elegiac ſtrain;
   admiration tempered with pity. Ever fond of giving, as he expreſſes it, “the joy of grief,” it is
   viſible that, on all moving ſubjects, he delights to exert his genius; and, accordingly, never

   preſent. His great art in managing them lies in giving vent to the ſimple and natural emotions of
   the heart. We meet with no exaggerated declamation; no ſubtile refinements on ſorrow; no
   ſubſtitution of deſcription in place of paſſion. Oſſian felt ſtrongly himſelf; and the heart,

   What, for inſtance, can be more moving than the lamentations of Oithona, after her miſfortune?
   Gaul, the ſon of Morni, her lover, ignorant of what ſhe had ſuffered, comes to her reſcue. Their
   meeting is tender in the higheſt degree. He propoſes to engage her foe, in ſingle combat, and
   gives her in charge what ſhe is to do if he himſelf ſhall fall. “And ſhall the daughter of Nuath
   live?” ſhe replied, with a burſting ſigh. “Shall I live in Tromathon, and the ſon of Morni low?
   My heart is not of that rock; nor my ſoul careleſs as that ſea, which lifts its blue waves to
   every wind, and rolls beneath the ſtorm. The blaſt, which ſhall lay thee low, ſhall ſpread the

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Oithona</span> mourns like a woman: in Cuthullin's expreſſions of grief after his
   defeat, we behold the ſentiments of a hero—generous, but deſponding. The ſituation is remarkably
   fine. Cuthullin, rouſed from his cave by the noiſe of battle, ſees Fingal victorious in the
   field. He is deſcribed as kindling at the ſight. “His hand is on the ſword of his fathers; his
   red-rolling eyes on the foe. He thrice attempted to ruſh to battle; and thrice did Connal ſtop

   to him alone. Cuthullin yields to this generous ſentiment; but we ſee it ſtinging him to the
   heart with the ſenſe of his own diſgrace. “Then, Carril, go,” replied the chief, “and greet the
   king of Morven. When Lochlin fails away like a ſtream after rain, and the noiſe of the battle is
   over, then be thy voice ſweet in his ear, to praiſe the king of ſwords. Give him the ſword of
   Caithbat; for Cuthullin is worthy no more to lift the arms of his fathers. But, O ye ghoſts of
   the lonely Cromla! ye ſouls of chiefs that are no more! be ye the companions of Cuthullin, and

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Beſides</span> ſuch extended pathetic ſcenes, Oſſian frequently pierces the heart
   by a ſingle unexpected ſtroke. When Oſcar fell in battle, “No father mourned his ſon ſlain in
   youth; no brother, his brother of love; they fell without tears, for the chief of the people was
   low.” In the admirable interview of Hector with Andromache, in the ſixth Iliad, the circumſtance
   of the child in his nurſe's arms, has often been remarked as adding much to the tenderneſs of the
   ſcene. In the following paſſage, relating to the death of Cuthullin, we find a circumſtance that
   muſt ſtrike the imagination with ſtill greater force. “And is the ſon of Semo fallen?” ſaid
   Carril, with a ſigh. “Mournful are Tura's walls, and ſorrow dwells at Dunſcaich. Thy ſpouſe is
   left alone in her youth; the ſon of thy love is alone. He ſhall come to Bragela, and aſk her why
   ſhe weeps? He ſhall lift his eyes to the wall, and ſee his father's ſword. Whoſe ſword is that?
   he will ſay; and the ſoul of his mother is ſad.” Soon after Fingal had ſhown all the grief of a
   father's heart for Ryno, one of his ſons, fallen in battle, he is calling, after his accuſtomed
   manner, his ſons to the chaſe. “Call,” ſays he, “Fillan and Ryno.—But he is not here.—My ſon

   is worthy of the higheſt tragic poet. <span class="quote">

   7.</dt></span> </p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> contrivance of the incident in both poets is ſimilar: but the
   circumſtances are varied with judgment. Othello dwells upon the name of wife, when it had fallen
   from him, with the confuſion and horror of one tortured with guilt. Fingal, with the dignity of a
   hero, corrects himſelf, and ſuppreſſes his riſing grief. </p>
  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> contraſt which Oſſian frequently makes between his preſent and his
   former ſtate, diffuſes over his whole poetry a ſolemn pathetic air, which cannot fail to make
   impreſſion on every heart. The concluſion of the ſongs of Selma is particularly calculated for
   this purpoſe. Nothing can be more poetical and tender, or can leave upon the mind a ſtronger and
   more affecting idea of the venerable and aged bard. “Such were the words of the bards in the days

   bards, and learn their pleaſant ſong. But memory fails on my mind; I hear the call of years. They
   ſay, as they paſs along, Why does Oſſian ſing? Soon ſhall he lie in the narrow houſe, and no bard
   ſhall raiſe his fame. Roll on, ye dark-brown years! for ye bring no joy in your courſe. Let the
   tomb open to Oſſian, for his ſtrength has failed. The ſons of the ſong are gone to reſt. My voice
   remains, like a blaſt, that roars lonely on the ſea-rur-rounded rock, after the winds are laid.

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Upon</span> the whole, if to feel ſtrongly, and to deſcribe naturally, be the two
   chief ingredients in poetical genius, Oſſian muſt, after fair examination, be held to poſſeſs
   that genius in a high degree. The queſtion is not, whether a few improprieties may be pointed out
   in his works?-whether this or that paſſage might not have been worked up with more art and ſkill,

   indeciſive as to his genuine merit. But has he the ſpirit, the fire the inſpiration of a poet?
   Does he utter the voice of nature? Does he elevate by his ſentiments? Does lie intereſt by his
   deſcription? Does be paint to the heart as well as to the fancy? Does he make his readers glow,
   and tremble, and weep? Theſe are the great characteriſtics of true poetry. Where theſe are found,
   he muſt be a minute critic, indeed, who can dwell, upon ſlight defects. A few beauties of this
   high kind tranſcend whole volumes of faultleſs mediocrity. Uncouth and abrupt Oſſian may
   ſometimes appear, by reaſon of his conciſeneſs; but he is ſublime, he is pathetic, in an eminent
   degree. If he has not the extenſive knowledge, the regular dignity of narration, the fulneſs and
   accuracy of deſcription, which we find in Homer and Virgil, yet in ſtrength of imagination, in
   grandeur of ſentiment, in native majeſty of paſſion, he is fully their equal. If he flows not
   always like a clear ſtream, yet he breaks forth often like a torrent of fire. Of art, too, he is
   far from being deſtitute; and his imagination is remarkable for delicacy as well as ſtrength.

Though his merit were in other
   reſpects much leſs than it is, this alone ought to entitle him to high regard, that his writings

  <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Though</span> unacquainted with the original language, there is no one but muſt
   judge the tranſlation to deſerve the higheſt praiſe, on account of its beauty and elegance. Of
   its faithfulneſs and accuracy, I have been aſſured by perſons ſkilled in the Gaelic tongue, who
   from their youth were acquainted with many of theſe poems of Oſſian. To tranſfuſe ſuch ſpirited
   and fervid ideas from one language into another; to tranſlate literally, and yet with ſuch a glow
   of poetry; to keep alive ſo much paſſion, and ſupport ſo much dignity throughout; is one of the
   moſt difficult works of genius, and proves the tranſlator to have been animated with no ſmall

   arrangement of words, it allows the ſpirit of the original to be exhibited, with more juſtneſs,

   muſt never forget, whilſt we read it, that we are putting the merit of the original to a ſevere
   teſt. For we are examining a poet ſtripped of his native dreſs; diveſted of the harmony of his
   own numbers. We know how much grace and energy the works of the Greek and Latin poets receive
   from the charm of verſification in their original languages. If then, deſtitute of this
   advantage, exhibited in a literal verſion, Oſſian ſtill has power to pleaſe as a poet; and not to
   pleaſe only, but often to command, to tranſport, to melt the heart; we may very ſafely infer that
   his productions are the off-ſpring of a true and uncommon genius; and we may proudly aſſign him a
   place among thoſe whoſe works are to laſt for ages.</p>

    a great friendſhip for one another. Oſcar, immediately after the death of Cathol, had ſent a
    formal challenge to Cairbar, which he prudently declined, but conceived a ſecret hatred againſt
    Oſcar, and had beforehand contrived to kill him at the feaſt, to which he here invites him. </p>
   </div><div id="note_idm45753335963808" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">

    Ireland, had, before the inſurrection of the Firbolg, paſſed over into Inis-huna, ſuppoſed to be
    a part of South-Britain, to aſſiſt Conmor king of that place againſt his enemies. Cathmor was
    ſucceſsful in the war, but, in the courſe of it, Conmor was either killed, or died a natural
    death. Cairbar, upon intelligence of the deſigns of Fingal to dethrone him, had diſpatched a
    meſſenger for Cathmor, who returned into Ireland a few days before the opening of the poem.</p>
   <p class="noindent">Cairbar here takes advantage of his brother's abſence, to perpetrate his ungenerous deſigns
    againſt Oſcar ; for the noble ſpirit of Cathmor, had he been preſent, would not have permitted
    the laws of that hoſpitality, for which he was ſo renowned himſelf, to be violated. The brothers
    form a contraſt : we do not deteſt the mean ſoul of Cairbar more, than we admire the
    difintereſted and generous mind of Cathmor. </p>

   <p class="noindent"> Fingal's army heard the joy that was in Cairbar's camp. The character given of Cathmor is
    agreeable to the times. Some, through oſtentation, were hoſpitable ; and others fell naturally
    into a cuſtom handed down from their anceſtors. But what marks ſtrongly the character of
    Cathmor, is his averſion to praiſe ; for he is repreſented to dwell in a wood to avoid the
    thanks of his gueſts; which is ſtill a higher degree of generoſity than that of Axylus in Homer
    : for the poet does not ſay, but the good man might, at the head of his own table, have heard
    with pleaſure the praiſe beſtowed on him by the people he entertained.</p>
   <p class="noindent">No nation in the world carried hoſpitality to a greater length than the ancient Scots. it was

    diſpoſition to an extravagant degree ; and the bards, perhaps upon a private account, never
    failed to recommend it, in their eulogiums. “<i>Cean uia' na dai</i>”, or <i>the point to
    which all the roads of the ſtrangers lead</i>, was an invariable epithet given by them to the
    chiefs; on the contrary, they diſtinguiſhed the inhoſpitable by the title of <i>the cloud which
    the ſtrangers ſhun</i>. This laſt however was ſo uncommon, that in all the old poems I have
    ever met with, I found but one man branded with this ignominious appellation; and that, perhaps,
    only founded upon a private quarrel, which ſubſiſted between him and the patron of the bard, who

   <p class="noindent">It is, however, certain, that the Iriſh bards diſguiſe, in ſome meaſure, this part of their

    concerning the battle of Gabhra, where Cairbar fell, is juſt now in my hands. As a tranſlation
    of the poem (which, tho' evidently no very ancient compoſition, does not want poetical merit)
    would extend this note to too great a length, I ſhall only give the ſtory of it in brief, with
    ſome extracts from the original Iriſh.</p>
   <p class="noindent">Oſcar, ſays the Iriſh bard, was invited to a feaſt, at Temora, by Cairbar king of Ireland. A
    diſpute aroſe between the two heroes, concerning the exchange of ſpears, which was uſually made,
    between the gueſts and their hoſt, upon ſuch occaſions, In the courſe of their altercation,
    Cairbar ſaid, in a boaſtful manner, that he would hunt on the hills of Albion, and carry the
    ſpoils of it into lreland, in ſpite of all the efforts of its inhabitants. The original words
    are ;</p>
   <span class="quote">

    <span class="line">A bheireadh an Cairbre rua', </span>

   </span>
   <p class="noindent">Oſcar replied, that, the next day, he himſelf would carry into Albion the ſpoils of the five
    provinces of Ireland; in ſpite of the oppoſition of Cairbar.</p>
   <span class="quote">

   <p class="noindent">Oſcar, in conſequence of his threats, began to lay waſte Ireland ; but as he returned with the
    ſpoil into Ulſter, thro' the narrow paſs of Gabhra (<i>Caorl ghlen Ghabhra</i>) he was met, by
    Cairbar, and a battle enſued, in which both the heroes fell by mutual wounds. The bard gives a
    very curious liſt of the followers of Oſcar, as they marched to battle. They appear to have been
    five hundred in number, commanded, as the poet expreſſes it, by <i>five heroes of the blood of
    kings</i> This poem mentions Fingal, as arriving from Scotland. before Oſcar died of his

   <p class="noindent"> Though this book has little action, it is not the leaſt important part of Temora. The poet,
    in ſeveral epiſodes, runs up the cauſe of the war to the very ſource. The firſt population of
    Ireland, the wars between the two nations who originally poſſeſſed that iſland, its firſt race
    of kings, and the revolutions of its government, are important facts, and are delivered by the
    poet, with ſo little mixture of the fabulous, that one cannot help preferring his accounts to
    the improbable fictions of the Scotch and Iriſh hiſtorians. The Mileſian fables bear about them
    the marks of a late invention. To trace their legends to their ſource would be no difficult taſk
    ; but a diſquiſition of this ſort would extend this note too far. </p>
   </div><div id="note_idm45753335800656" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">
   <p class="noindent"> We underſtand, from the preceding book, that Cathmor was near with an army. When Cairbar was
    killed, the tribes who attended him fell back to Cathmor; who, as it afterwards appears, had
    taken a reſolution to ſurprize Fingal by night. Fillan was diſpatched to the hill of Mora, which
    was in the front of the Caledonians, to obſerve the motions of Cathmor. In this ſituation were
    affairs when Oſſian, upon hearing the noiſe of the approaching enemy, went to find out his
    brother. Their converſation naturally introduces the epiſode, concerning Conar the ſon of
    Trenmor, the firſt Iriſh monarch, which is ſo neceſſary to the underſtanding the foundation of
    the rebellion and uſurpation of Cairbar and Cathmor. Fillan was the youngeſt of the ſons of
    Fingal, then living. He and Boſmina, mentioned in the <i>battle of Lora</i>, were the only
    children of the king, by Clatho the daughter of Cathulla king of Inis-tore, whom he had taken to
    wife, after the death of Ros-crana, the daughter of Cormac Mac-Conar king of Ireland. </p>
   </div><div id="note_idm45753335793888" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">
   <p class="noindent"> That is, two ſons in Ireland. Fergus, the ſecond ſon of Fingal, was, at that time, on an
    expedition, which is mentioned in one of the leſſer poems. He, according to ſome traditions, was
    the anceſtor of Fergus, the ſon of Erc or Arcath, commonly called <i>Fergus the ſecond</i> in
    the Scotch hiſtories. The beginning of the reign of Fergus over the Scots, is placed, by the
    moſt approved annals of Scotland, in the fourth year of the fifth age : a full century after the
    death of Oſſian. The genealogy of his family is recorded thus by the Highland Senachies;
    <i>Fergus Mac Arcath Mac Chongael, Mac-Fergus, Mac-Fien-gäal na buai'</i>; i. e. Fergus the
    ſon of Arcath, the ſon of Congal, the ſon of Fergus, the ſon of Fingal <i>the victorious</i>.
    This ſubject is treated more at large, in the diſſertation annexed to the poem. </p>

   <p class="noindent"> The ſouthern parts of Ireland went, for ſome time, under the name of Bolga, from the Fir-bolg
    or Belgæ of Britain, who ſettled a colony there. <i>Bolg</i> ſignifies <i>a quiver</i>, from

   <p class="noindent"> After this paſſage, Oſcar is not mentioned in all Temora. The ſituations of the characters
    who act in the poem are ſo intereſting, that others, foreign to the ſubject, could not be
    introduced with any luſtre. Though the epiſode, which follows, may ſeem to flow naturally enough
    from the converſation of the brothers, yet I have ſhewn, in a preceding note, and, more at
    large, in the diſſertation annexed to this collection, that the poet had a farther deſign in
    view. </p>
   </div><div id="note_idm45753335777184" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">
   <p class="noindent"> Conar, the firſt king of Ireland, was the ſon of Trenmor, the great-grand-father of Fingal.
    It was on account of this family-connection, that Fingal was engaged in ſo many wars in the
    cauſe of the race of Conar. Tho' few of the actions of Trenmor are mentioned, he was the moſt
    renowned name of antiquity. The moſt probable opinion concerning him is, that he was the firſt,
    who united the tribes of the Caledonians, and commanded them, in chief, againſt the incurſions
    of the Romans. The genealogiſts of the North have traced his family far back, and given a liſt
    of his anceſtors to <i>Cuan-mór nan lan</i>, or Conmor of the ſwords, who, according to them,
    was the firſt who croſſed the <i>great ſea</i>, to Caledonia, from which circumſtance his name
    proceeded, which ſignifies <i>Great ocean</i>. Genealogies of ſo ancient a date, however, are
    little to be depended upon. </p>

   <p class="noindent"> The chiefs of the Fir-bolg who poſſeſſed themſelves of the ſouth of Ireland, prior, perhaps,
    to the ſettlement of the <i>Caël</i> of Caledonia, and the Hebrides, in Ulſter. From the
    ſequel, it appears that the Fir-bolg were, by much, the moſt powerful nation; and it is probable
    that the Caël muſt have ſubmitted to them, had they not received ſuccours from their
    mother-country, under the command of Conar. </p>
   </div><div id="note_idm45753335765296" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">
   <p class="noindent"> Colg-er, <i>fiercely-looking warrior</i>. Sulin-corma, <i>blue eyes</i>. Colgar was the
    eldeſt of the ſons of Trathal: Comhal, who was the father of Fingal, was very young when the
    preſent expedition to Ireland happened, It is remarkable, that, of all the anceſtors of Fingal,
    tradition makes the leaſt mention of Comhal ; which, probably, proceeded from the unfortunate
    life and untimely death of that hero. From ſome paſſages, concerning him, we learn, indeed, that
    he was brave, but he wanted conduct. </p>
   </div><div id="note_idm45753335757120" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">
   <p class="noindent"> The poem begins here to mark ſtrongly the character of Fillan, who is to make ſo great a
    figure in the ſequel. He has the impatience, the ambition and fire which are peculiar to a young
    hero. Kindled with the fame of Colgar, he forgets his untimely fall. From Fillan's expreſſions
    in this paſſage, it would ſeem, that he was neglected by Fingal, on account of his youth. </p>

   <p class="noindent"> Crothar was the anceſtor of Cathmor, and the firſt of his family, who had ſettled in Atha, It
    was, in his time, that the firſt wars were kindled between the Fir-bolg and Cal. The propriety
    of the epiſode is evident; as the conteſt which originally roſe between Crothar and Conar,
    ſubſiſted afterwards between their poſterity, and was the foundation of the ſtory of the poem.
   </p>
   </div><div id="note_idm45753335720400" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">
   <p class="noindent"> From this circumſtance we may learn that the art of building with ſtone was not known in
    Ireland ſo early as the days of Crothar. When the colony were long ſettled in the country, the
    arts of civil life began to increaſe among them, for we find mention made of the <i>towers of
    Atha</i> in the time of Cathmor, which could not well be applied to wooden buildings. In
    Caledonia they begun very early to build with ſtone. None of the houſes of Fingal, excepting
    Ti-foirmal, were of wood. Ti-foirmal was the great hall where the bards met to repeat their
    compoſitions annually, before they ſubmitted them to the judgment of the king in Selma. By ſome
    accident or other, this wooden houſe happened to be burnt, and an ancient bard, in the character
    of Oſſian, has left us a curious catalogue of the furniture which it contained. The poem is not
    juſt now in my hands, otherwiſe I would lay here a tranſlation of it before the reader. It has
    little poetical merit, and evidently bears the marks of a later period. </p>

   <p class="noindent"> Alnecma, or Alnecmacht, was the ancient name of Connaught. Ullin is ſtill the Iriſh name of

   <p class="noindent"> The delicacy here, with regard to Crothar, is proper. As he was the anceſtor of Cathmor, to
    whom the epiſode is addreſſed, the bard ſoftens his defeat, by only mentioning that his people
    fled. Cathmor took the ſong of Fonar in an unfavourable light. The bards, being of the order of
    the Druids, who pretended to a foreknowlege of events, were ſuppoſed to have ſome ſupernatural
    preſcience of futurity. The king thought, that the choice of Fonar's ſong proceeded, from his
    foreſeeing the unfortunate iſſue of the war ; and that his own fate was ſhadowed out, in that of
    his anceſtor Crothar. The attitude of the bard, after the reprimand of his patron, is
    pictureſque and affecting, We admire the ſpeech of Cathmor, but lament the effect it has on the
    feeling ſoul of the good old poet. </p>

    Oſſian to fulfil immediately the promiſe he had made to Cathmor, of cauſing the <i>funeral

   <p class="noindent"> There are ſome traditions, but, I believe, of late invention, that this Colgach was the ſame
    with the Galgacus of Tacitus. He was the anceſtor of Gaul, the ſon of Morni, and appears, from
    ſome, really ancient, traditions, to have been king, or Vergobret, of the Caledonians ; and
    hence proceeded the pretenſions of the family of Morni to the throne, which created a good deal
    of diſturbance, both to Comhal and his ſon Fingal. The firſt was killed in battle by that tribe
    ; and it was after Fingal was grown up, that they were reduced to obedience. Colgach ſignifies
    <i>fiercely-looking</i> ; which is a very proper name for a warrior, and is probably the
    origin of Galgacus; though I believe it a matter of mere conjecture, that the Colgach here
    mentioned was the ſame with that hero. I cannot help obſerving, that the ſong of the bards is
    conducted with propriety. Gaul, whoſe experience might have rendered his conduct cautious in
    war, has the example of his father, juſt ruſhing to battle, ſet before his eyes. Fillan, on the

   <p class="noindent">In order to illuſtrate this paſſage, I ſhall give, here, the hiſtory on which it is founded,
    as I have gathered it from tradition. The nation of the Firbolg who inhabited the ſouth of
    ireland, being originally deſcended from the Belgæ, who poſſeſſed the ſouth and ſouth-weſt coaſt
    of Britain, kept up, for many ages, an amicable correſpondence with their mother-country ; and
    ſent aid to the Britiſh Belgæ, when they were preſſed by the Romans or other new-comers from the
    continent. Con-mor, king of Inis-huna, (that part of South-Britain which is over-againſt the
    Iriſh coaſt) being attacked, by what enemy is not mentioned, ſent for aid to Cairbar, lord of
    Atha, the moſt potent chief of the Firbolg. Cairbar diſpatched his brother Cathmor to the
    afſiſtance of Con-mor. Cathmor, after various viciſſitudes of fortune, put an end to the war, by
    the total defeat of the enemies of Inis-huna, and returned in triumph to the reſidence of
    Con-mor. There, at a feaſt, Sul-malla, the daughter of Con-mor, fell deſperately in love with
    Cathmor, who, before her paſſion was diſcloſed, was recalled to Ireland by his brother Cairbar,
    upon the news of the intended expedition of Fingal, to re-eſtabliſh the family of Conar on the
    Iriſh throne. The wind being contrary, Cathmor remained, for three days, in a neighbouring bay,
    during which time Sul-malla diſguiſed herſelf in the habit of a young warrior, and came to offer
    him her ſervice, in the war. Cathmor accepted of the propoſal, ſailed for Ireland, and arrived
    in Ulſter a few days before the death of Cairbar. </p>
   </div><div id="note_idm45753335427792" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">

   <p class="noindent"> Fithil, <i>an inferior bard</i>. It may either be taken here for the proper name of a man,
    or in the literal ſenſe, as the bards were the heralds and meſſengers of thoſe times. Cathmor,
    it is probable, was abſent, when the rebellion of his brother Cairbar, and the aſſaſſination of
    Cormac, king of Ireland, happened. Cathmor and his followers had only arrived, from Inis-huna,
    three days before the death of Cairbar, which ſufficiently clears his character from any
    imputation of being concerned in the conſpiracy, with his brother. </p>
   </div><div id="note_idm45753335420128" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">
   <p class="noindent"> The ceremony which was uſed by Fingal, when he prepared for an expedition, is related thus in
    tradition. A bard, at midnight, went to the hall, where the tribes feaſted upon ſolemn
    occaſions, raiſed the <i>war-ſong</i>, and thrice called the ſpirits of their deceaſed
    anceſtors to come, <i>on their clouds</i>, to behold the actions of their children. He then
    fixed the <i>ſhield of Trenmor</i>, on a tree on the rock of Selma, ſtriking it, at times,
    with the blunt end ofa ſpear, and ſinging the war-ſong between. Thus he did, for three
    ſucceſſive nights, and, in the mean time, meſſengers were diſpatched to call together the
    tribes; or, to uſe an ancient expreſſion, <i>to call them from all their ſtreams</i>. This
    phraſe alludes to the ſituation of the reſidences of the clans, which were generally fixed in
    valleys, where the torrents of the neighbouring mountains were colleted into one body, and
    became <i>large ſtreams</i> or rivers. <i>The lifting up of the ſhield</i>, was the phraſe

   <p class="noindent"> This compariſon is favourable to the ſuperiority of Cathmor over his two chiefs, I ſhall
    illuſtrate this paſſage with another from a fragment of an ancient poem, juſt now in my hands.
    “As the ſun is above the vapours, which his beams have raiſed ; ſo is the ſoul of the king above
    the ſons of fear. They roll dark below him; he rejoices in the robe of his beams. But when
    feeble deeds wander on the ſoul of the king, he is a darkened ſun rolled along the ſky: the
    valley is ſad below : flowers wither beneath the drops of the night.” </p>

   <p class="noindent"> Lear-thon, <i>ſea wave</i>, the name of the chief of that colony of the Fir-bolg, which
    firſt migrated into Ireland. Larthon's firſt ſettlement in that country is related in the
    ſeventh book. He was the anceſtor of Cathmor ; and is here called <i>Larthon of Lumon</i>,
    from a high hill of that name in Inis-huna, the ancient ſeat of the Fir-bolg. The character of
    Cathmor is preſerved. He had mentioned, in the firſt book, the averſion of that chief to praiſe,
    and we find him here lying at the ſide of a ſtream, that the noiſe of it might drown the voice
    of Fonar, who, according to the cuſtom of the times, ſung his eulogium in his <i>evening
    ſong</i>. Though other chiefs, as well as Cathmor, might be averſe to hear their own praiſe, we
    find it the univerſal policy of the times, to allow the bards to be as extravagant as they
    pleaſed in their encomiums on the leaders of armies, in the preſence of their people. The
    vulgar, who had no great ability to judge for themſelves, received the characters of their
    princes, entirely upon the faith of their bards. </p>

   <p class="noindent"> Carril, the ſon of Kinfena, by the orders of Oſſian, ſung the funeral elegy at the tomb of
    Cairbar. See the ſecond book, towards the end. In all theſe poems, the viſits of ghoſts, to
    their living friends, are ſhort, and their language obſcure, both which circumſtances tend to
    throw a ſolemn gloom on theſe ſupernatural ſcenes. Towards the latter end of the ſpeech of the
    ghoſt of Cairbar, he foretels the death of Cathmor, by enumerating thoſe ſignals which,
    according to the opinion of the times, preceded the death of a perſon renowned. It was thought
    that the ghoſts of deceaſed bards ſung, for three nights preceding the death (near the place
    where his tomb was to be raiſed) round an unſubſtantial figure which repreſented the body of the
    perſon who was to die. </p>
   </div><div id="note_idm45753335369360" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">
   <p class="noindent">The ſoliloquy of Cathmor ſuits the magnanimity of his character. Though ſtaggered at firſt
    with the prediction of Cairbar's ghoſt, he ſoon comforts himſelf with the agreeable proſpect of
    his future renown; and, like Achilles, prefers a ſhort and glorious life, to an obſcure length
    of years in retirement and eaſe. </p>
   </div><div id="note_idm45753335365648" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">
   <p class="noindent"> An indolent and unwarlike life was held in extreme contempt. Whatever a philoſopher may ſay,
    in praiſe of quiet and retirement, I am far from thinking, but they weaken and debaſe the human
    mind. When the faculties of the ſoul are not exerted, they loſe their vigour, and low and
    circumſcribed notions take the place of noble and enlarged ideas. Action, on the contrary, and
    the viciſſitudes of fortune which attend it, call forth, by turns, all the powers of the mind,
    and, by exerciſing, ſtrengthen them. Hence it is, that in great and opulent ſtates, when
    property and indolence are ſecured to individuals, we ſeldom meet with that ſtrength of mind,
    which is ſo common in a nation, not far advanced in civilization. It is a curious, but juſt,
    obſervation ; that great kingdoms ſeldom produce great characters, which muſt be altogether
    attributed to that indolence and diſſipation, which are the inſeparable companions of too much
    property and ſecurity. Rome, it is certain, had more real great men within it, when its power
    was confined within the narrow bounds of Latium, than when its dominion extended over all the
    known world ; and one petty ſtate of the Saxon heptarchy had, perhaps, as much genuine ſpirit in
    it, as the two Britiſh kingdoms united. As a ſtate, we are much more powerful than our

   <p class="noindent"> In order to underſtand this paſſage, it is neceſſary to look to the deſcription of Cathmor's
    ſhield in the ſeventh book. This ſhield had ſeven principal boſſes, the ſound of each of which,
    when ſtruck with a ſpear, conveyed a particular order from the king to his tribes. The ſound of
    one of them, as here, was the ſignal for the army to aſſemble. </p>

   <p class="noindent"> Con-mor, the father of Sul-malla, was killed in that war, from which Cathmor delivered
    Inis-huna. Lormar his ſon ſucceeded Conmor. It was the opinion of the times, when a perſon was
    reduced to a pitch of miſery, which could admit of no alleviation, that the ghoſts of his
    anceſtors <i>called his ſoul away</i>. This ſupernatural kind of death was called the
    <i>voice of the dead</i>; and is believed by the ſuperſtitious vulgar to this day. There is no
    people in the world, perhaps, who give more univerſal credit to apparitions, and the viſits of
    the ghoſts of the deceaſed to their friends, than the ancient Scots. This is to be attributed as
    much, at leaſt, to the ſituation of the country they poſſeſs, as to that credulous diſpoſition
    which diſtinguiſhes an unenlightened people. As their buſineſs was feeding of cattle, in dark
    and extenſive deſarts, ſo their journeys lay over wide and unfrequented heaths, where, often,
    they were obliged to ſleep in the open air, amidſt the whiſtling of winds, and roar of
    water-falls. The gloomineſs of the ſcenes around them was apt to beget that melancholy
    diſpoſition of mind, which moſt readily receives impreſſions of the extraordinary and
    ſupernatural kind, Falling aſleep in this gloomy mood, and their dreams being diſturbed by the
    noiſe of the elements around, it is no matter of wonder, that they thought they heard the
    <i>voice of the dead</i>, This <i>voice of the dead</i>, however, was, perhaps, no more than
    a ſhriller whiſtle of the winds in an old tree, or in the chinks of a neighbouring rock. It is
    to this cauſe I aſcribe thoſe many and improbable tales of ghoſts, which we meet with in the
    Highlands: for, in other reſpects, we do not find that the inhabitants are more credulous than
    their neighbours. </p>

    Temora. At a ſmall diſtance from one another roſe the hills of Mora and Lora; the firſt
    poſſeſſed by Fingal, the ſecond by the army of Cathmor. Through the intermediate plain ran the
    ſmall river Lubar, on the banks of which all the battles were fought, excepting that between
    Cairbar and Oſcar, related in the firſt book. This laſt mentioned engagement happened to the
    north of the hill of Mora, of which Fingal took poſſeſſion, after the army of Cairbar fell back
    to that of Cathmor. At ſome diſtance, but within ſight of Mora, towards the weſt, Lubar iſſued
    from the mountain of Crommal, and, after a ſhort courſe through the plain of Moi lena,
    diſcharged itſelf into the ſea near the field of battle. Behind the mountain of Crommal ran the
    ſmall ſtream of Lavath, on the banks of which Ferad-artho, the ſon of Cairbre, the only perſon
    remaining of the race of Conar, lived concealed in a cave, during the uſurpation of Cairbar, the

    their many expeditions to Orkney and Scandinavia, became acquainted with ſome of the rites of
    the religion, which prevailed in thoſe countries, and the ancient poetry frequently alludes to
    them. There are ſome ruins, and circular pales of ſtone, remaining ſtill in Orkney, and the
    iſlands of Shetland, which retain, to this day, the name of <i>Loda</i> or <i>Loden</i>.
    They ſeem to have differed materially, in their conſtruction, from thoſe Druidical monuments
    which remain in Britain, and the weſtern iſles. The places of worſhip among the Scandinavians
    were originally rude and unadorned. In after ages, when they opened a communication with other
    nations, they adopted their manners, and built temples. That at Upſal, in Sweden, was amazingly
    rich and magnificent. Harquin, of Norway, built one, near Drontheim, little inferior to the
    former; and it went always under the name of Loden. <i>Mallet, introduction a l'hiſtoire de

    ſuppoſed to underſtand that her ſon is killed ; in which ſhe is confirmed by the appearance of
    his ghoſt. Her ſudden and ſhort exclamation is more judicious in the poet, than if ſhe had
    extended her complaints to a greater length. The attitude of the fallen youth, and Fillan's
    reflexions over him, come forcibly back on the mind, when we conſider, that the ſuppoſed

   <p class="noindent"> This valley had its name from Clono, ſon of Lethmal of Lora, one of the anceſtors of Dermid,
    the ſon of Duthno. His hiſtory is thus related in an old poem. In the days of Conar, the ſon of
    Trenmor, the firſt king of Ireland, Clono paſſed over into that kingdom, from Caledonia, to aid
    Conar againſt the Fir-bolg. Being remarkable for the beauty of his perſon, he ſoon drew the
    attention of Sulmin, the young wife of an Iriſh chief. She diſcloſed her paſſion, which was not
    properly returned by the Caledonian. The lady ſickened, thro' diſappointment, and her love for
    Clono came to the ears of her huſband. Fired with jealouſy, he vowed revenge. Clono, to avoid
    his rage, departed from Temora, in order to paſs over into Scotland ; and, being benighted in
    the valley mentioned, here, he laid him down to ſleep. <i>There Lethmal deſcended in the dreams
    of Clono, and told him that danger was near</i>.</p>

    Morna, to enquire of the ſpirits of his fathers, concerning the ſucceſs of the enterpriſe of
    Cairbar. The reſponſes of oracles are always attended with obſcurity, and liable to a double

   <br/>
   <p class="noindent">Cloncath, or <i>reflected beam</i>, ſay my traditional authors, was the name of the ſword of
    Fillan; ſo that it was, in the latent ſignification of the word <i>Clonath</i>, that the
    deception lay. My principal reaſon for introducing this note, is, that this tradition ſerves to
    ſhew, that the religion of the Fir-bolg differed from that of the Caledonians, as we never find

    in a different way. Foldath was impetuous and cruel., Malthos ſtubborn and incredulous. Their
    attachment to the family of Atha was equal; their bravery in battle the ſame. Foldath was vain
    and oſtentatious: Malthos unindulgent but generous. His behaviour here, towards his enemy
    Foldath, ſhews, that a good heart often lies concealed under a gloomy and ſullen character. </p>

    to return to aſſiſt the king in proſecuting the war. But then his ſhame for not defending his

    as in the act of advancing towards the enemy, when the horn of Fingal ſounded on Mora, and
    called back his people to his preſence. This ſoliloquy is natural : the reſolutions which ſo
    ſuddenly follow one another, are expreſſive of a mind extremely agitated with ſorrow and
    conſcious ſhame ; yet the behaviour of Oſſian, in his execution of the commands of Fingal, is ſo
    irreprehenſible, that it is not eaſy to determine where he failed in his duty. The truth is,

    himſelf, arc circumſtances calculated to impreſs an awful idea on the mind. Oſſian is moſt
    ſucceſsful in his night-deſcriptions. Dark images ſuited the melancholy temper of his mind. His

    the whole.” </p>
   </div><div id="note_idm45753335133712" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">
   <p class="noindent">I owe the firſt paragraph of the following note to the ſame pen.</p>
   <p class="noindent">The abaſhed behaviour of the army of Fingal proceeds rather from ſhame than fear. The king was
    not of a tyrannical diſpoſition : <i>He</i>, as he profeſſes himſelf in the fifth book,
    <i>never was a dreadful form, in their preſence, darkened into wrath. His voice was no thunder
    to their ears : his eye ſent forth no death</i>. The firſt ages of ſociety are not the times of
    arbitrary power. As the wants of mankind are few, they retain their independence. It is an
    advanced ſtate of civilization that moulds the mind to that ſubmiſſion to government, of which
    ambitious magiſtrates take advantage, and raiſe themſelves into abſolute power.</p>
   <p class="noindent">It is a vulgar error, that the common Highlanders lived, in abject ſlavery, under their
    chiefs. Their high ideas of, and attachment to, the heads of their families, probably, led the
    unintelligent into this miſtake. When the honour of the tribe was concerned, the commands of the
    chief were obeyed, without reſtriction : but, if individuals were oppreſſed, they threw
    themſelves into the arms of a neighbouring clan, aſſumed a new name, and were encouraged and
    protected. The fear of this deſertion, no doubt, made the chiefs cautious in their government.
    As their conſequence, in the eyes of others, was in proportion to the number of their people,
    they took care to avoid every thing that tended to diminiſh it.</p>
   <p class="noindent">It was but very lately that the authority of the laws extended to the Highlands. Before that
    time the clans were governed, in Civil affairs, not by the verbal commands of the chief, but by
    what they called <i>Clechda</i>, or the traditional precedents of their anceſtors. When
    differences happened between individuals, ſome of the oldeſt men in the tribe were choſen
    umpires between the parties, to decide according to the <i>Clechda</i>. The chief interpoſed
    his authority, and, invariably, enforced the deciſion. In their wars, which were frequent, on
    account of family-feuds, the chief was leſs reſerved in the execution of his authority ; and
    even then he ſeldom extended it to the taking the life of any of his tribe. No crime was
    capital, except murder ; and that was very unfrequent in the Highlands. No corporal puniſhment,
    of any kind, was inflicted. The memory of an affront of this ſort would remain, for ages, in a
    family, and they would ſeize every opportunity to be revenged, unleſs it came immediately from
    the hands of the chief himſelf; in that caſe it was taken, rather as a fatherly correction, than
    a legal puniſhment for offences. </p>

   <p class="noindent"> This rock of Cormul is often mentioned in the preceding part of the poem, It was on it Fingal
    and Oſſian ſtood to view the battle. The cuſtom of retiring from the army, on the night prior to
    their engaging in battle, was univerſal among the kings of the Caledonians. Trenmor, the moſt
    renowned of the anceſtors of Fingal, is mentioned as the firſt who inſtituted this cuſtom.
    Succeeding bards attributed it to a hero of a latter period. In an old poem, which begins with
    <i><i>MacArcath na ceud ſról</i></i>, this cuſtom of retiring from
    the army, before an engagement, is numbered, among the wiſe inſtitutions of Fergus, the ſon of
    Arc or Arcath, the firft king of Scots. I ſhall here tranſlate the paſſage; in ſome other note I
    may probably, give all that remains of the poem. <span class="quote"><i>Fergus of the hundred ſtreams, ſon

   <p class="noindent"> In order to illuſtrate this paſſage, it is proper to lay before the reader the ſcene of the
    two preceding battles. Beween the hills of Mora and Lona lay the plain of Moi-lena, through
    which ran the river Lubar. The firſt battle, wherein Gaul, the ſon of Mozni, commanded on the
    Caledonian ſide, was fought on the banks of Lubar. As there was little advantage obtained, on
    either ſide, the armies, after the battle, retained their former poſitions.</p>
   <p class="noindent">In the ſecond battle, wherein Fillan commanded, the Iriſh after the fall of Foldath, were
    driven up the hill of Lona; but, upon the coming of Cathmor to their aid, they regained their
    former ſituation, and drove back the Caledonians, in their turn; ſo that <i>Lubar winded again

   <p class="noindent"> Borbar-duthul, the father of Cathmor, was the brother of that Colc-ulla, who is ſaid, in the
    beginning of the fourth book, to have rebelled againſt Cormac king of Ireland. Borbar-duthul
    ſeems to have retained all the prejudice of his family againſt the ſucceſſion of the poſterity
    of Conar, on the Iriſh throne. From this ſhort epiſode we learn ſome facts which tend to throw
    light on the hiſtory of the times. It appears, that, when Swaran invaded Ireland, he was only
    oppoſed by the Caël, who poſſeſſed Ulſter, and the north of that iſland. Calmar, the ſon of
    Matha, whoſe gallant behaviour and death are related in the third book of Fingal, was the only
    chief of the race of the Fir-bolg, that joined the Cael, or Iriſh Caledonians, during the
    invaſion of Swaran. The indecent joy, which Borbar-duthul expreſſed, upon the death of Calmar,
    is well ſuited with that ſpirit of revenge, which ſubſiſted, univerſally, in every country where
    the feudal ſyſtem was eſtabliſhed. It would appear that ſome perſon had carried to Borbar-duthul
    that weapon, with which, it was pretended, Calmar had been killed. </p>

   </div><div id="note_idm45753335085152" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">
   <p class="noindent"> Not only the kings, but every petty chief, had anciently their bards attending them, in the
    field ; and thoſe bards, in proportion to the power of the chiefs, who retained them, had a
    number of inferior bards in their train. Upon ſolemn occaſions, all the bards, in the army,
    would join in one chorus; either when they celebrated their victories, or lamented the death of
    a perſon, worthy and renowned, ſlain in the war. The words were of the compoſition of the
    arch-bard, retained by the king himſelf, who generally attained to that high office on account
    of his ſuperior genius for poetry. As the perſons of the bards were ſacred, and the emoluments
    of their office conſiderable, the order, in ſucceeding times, became very numerous and inſolent.
    It would appear, that, after the introduction of Chriſtianity, ſome ſerved in the double
    capacity of bards and clergymen. It was, from this circumſtance, that they had the name of
    <i>Chlére</i>, which is, probably, derived from the Latin Clericus. The <i>Chlére</i>, be
    their name derived from what it will, became, at laſt, a public nuiſance; for, taking advantage
    of their ſacred character, they went about, in great bodies, and lived, at diſcretion, in the
    houſes of the chiefs ; till another party, of the ſame order, drove them away by mere dint of
    ſatire. Some of the indelicate diſputes of theſe worthy poetical combatants are handed down, by
    tradition, and ſhew how much the bards, at laſt, abuſed the privileges, which the admiration of
    their countrymen had conferred on the order. It was this inſolent behaviour that induced the
    chiefs to retrench their number, and to take away thoſe privileges which they were no longer
    worthy to enjoy. Their indolence, and diſpoſition to lampoon, extinguiſhed all the poetical
    fervour, which diſtinguiſhed their predeceſſors, and makes us the leſs regret the extinction of
    the order. </p>

    magnitude of the perſons introduced ; but, being unnatural, they are inſipid and tedious. Had
    the bard kept within the bounds of probability, his genius was far from being contemptible. The

   <p class="noindent"> Ferad-artho was the ſon of Cairbar Mac-Cormac king of Ireland. He was the only one remaining
    of the race of Conar, the ſon of Trenmor, the firſt Iriſh monarch, according to Oſſian. In order
    to make this paſſage thoroughly underſtood, it may not be improper to recapitulate ſome part of
    what has been ſaid in preceding notes. Upon the death of Conar the ſon of Trenmor, his ſon
    Cormac ſucceeded on the Irifh throne. Cormac reigned long. His children were, Cairbar, who
    ſucceeded him, and Ros-crana, the firſt wife of Fingal. Cairbar, long before the death of his
    father Cormac, had taken to wife Bos-gala, the daughter of Colgar, one of the moſt powerful
    chiefs in Connaught, and had, by her, Artho, afterwards king of ſreland. Soon after Artho
    arrived at man's eſtate, his mother Bos-gala died, and Cairbar married Beltanno, the daughter of
    Conachar of Ullin, who brought him a ſon, whom he called Ferad artho, i. e. <i>a man in the
    place of Artho</i>. The occaſion of the name was this. Artho, when his brother was born, was
    abſent, on an expedition, in the ſouth of Ireland. A falſe report was brought to his father,
    that he was killed. <i>Cairbar</i>, to uſe the words of a poem on the ſubject, <i>darkened
    for his fair-haired ſon. He turned to the young beam of light, the ſon of Baltanno of Conachar.
    Thou ſhalt be Farad-artho, he ſaid, a fire before thy race</i>. Cairbar, ſoon after, died, nor
    did Artho long ſurvive him. Artho was ſucceeded, in the Iriſh throne, by his ſon Cormac, who, in
    his minority, was murdered by Cairbar, the ſon of Borbar-duthul. Ferad-artho, ſays tradition,
    was very young, when the expedition of Fingal, to ſettle him on the throne of Ireland, happened.
    During the ſhort reign of young Cormac, Feradartho lived at the royal reſidence of Temora. Upon
    the murder of the king, Condan, the bard, conveyed Ferad-artho, privately, to the cave of Cluna,
    behind the mountain Crommal, in Ulſter, where they both lived concealed, during the uſurpation
    of the family of Atha. A late bard has delivered the whole hiſtory, in a poem juſt now in my
    poſſeſſion. It has little merit, if we except the ſcene between Ferad-artho, and the meſſengers
    of Fingal, upon their arrival, in the valley of Cluna. After hearing of the great actions of
    Fingal, the young prince propoſes the following queſtions concerning him, to Gaul and Dermid,
    “Is the king tall as the rock of my cave? Is his ſpear a fir of Cluna ? Is he a rough-winged
    blaſt, on the mountain, which takes the green oak by the head, and tears it from its hill?
    Glitters Lubar within his ſtride, when he ſends his flately ſteps along. Nor is he tall, ſaid
    Gaul, as that rock: nor glitter ſtreams within his ſtrides, but his ſoul is a mighty flood, like

     but, on my brightneſs, is the wandering of tears. Darkneſs flies over my ſoul, as the duſky
     wave of the breeze, along the graſs of Lutha. Yet have not the roes failed me, when I moved
     between the hills. Pleaſant, beneath my white hand, aroſe the ſound of harps. What then,
     daughter of Lutha, travels over thy ſoul, like the dreary path a ghoſt, along the nightly beam
     ? Should the young warrior fall, in the roar of his troubled fields! Young virgins of Lutha
     ariſe, call back the wandering thoughts of Malvina. Awake the voice of the harp, along my

   <p class="noindent"> The Iriſh compoſitions concerning Fingal invariably ſpeaks of him as a giant. Of theſe
    Hibernian poems there are now many in my hands. From the language, and alluſions to the times in
    which they were writ, I ſhould fix the date of their compoſition in the fifteenth and ſixteenth
    centuries. In ſome paſſages, the poetry is far from wanting merit, but the fable is unnatural,
    and the whole conduct of the pieces injudicious. I ſhall give one inſtance of the extravagant
    fictions of the Iriſh bards, in a poem which they, moſt unjuſtly, aſcribe to Oſſian. The ſtory
    of it is this: Ireland being threatened with an invaſion from ſome part of Scandinavia, Fingal
    ſent Oſſian, Oſcar, and Ca-olt, to watch the bay, in which, it was expected, the enemy was to
    land. Oſcar, unluckily, fell aſleep, before the Scandinavians appeared ; and, great as he was,
    ſays the Iriſh bard, he had one bad property, that no leſs could waken him, before his time,
    than cutting off one of his fingers, or throwing a great ſtone againſt his head ; and it was
    dangerous to come near him on thoſe occaſions, till he had recovered himſelf, and was fully
    awake.</p>
   <p class="noindent">Ca-olt, who was employed by Oſſian to waken his ſon, made choice of throwing the ſtone againſt
    his head, as the leaſt dangerous expedient. The ſtone, rebounding from the hero's head, ſhook,
    as it rolled along, the hill for three miles round. Oſcar roſe in rage, fought bravely, and,
    ſingly, vanquiſhed a wing of the enemy's army. Thus the bard goes on, till Fingal put an end to
    the war, by the total rout of the Scandinavians. Puerile, and even deſpicable, as theſe fictions
    are, yet Keating and O'Flaherty have no better authority than the poems which contain them, for
    all that they write concerning Fion Mac-comnal, and the pretended militia of Ireland. </p>

    kings, can be ſaid. <i>A column of miſt</i> is thrown over the whole, and the combat is left
    to the imagination of the reader. Poets have almoſt univerſally failed in their deſcriptions of
    this ſort. Not all the ſtrength of Homer could ſuſtain, with dignity, the <i>minutiæ</i> of a
    ſingle combat. The throwing of a ſpear, and the braying of a ſhield, as ſome of our own poets
    moſt elegantly expreſs it, convey no magnificent, though they are ſtriking ideas. Our
    imagination ſtretches beyond, and conſequently, deſpiſes, the deſcription. It were, therefore,

    be attributed to the revolutions and domeſtic confuſions which happened in that iſland, and
    utterly cut off all the real traditions concerning ſo ancient a period. All that we have related
    of the ſtate of lreland before the fifth century is of late invention, and the work of ill
    informed ſenachies and injudicious bards. </p>

   <p class="noindent"> The Celtic nations had ſome idea of rewards, and perhaps of puniſhments, after death. Thoſe
    who behaved, in life, with bravery and virtue, were received, with joy, to the airy halls of
    their fathers; but <i>the dark in ſoul</i>, to uſe the expreſſion of the poet, were ſpurned
    away <i>from the habitation of heroes, to wander on all the winds</i>. Another opinion, which
    prevailed in thoſe times, tended not a little to make individuals emulous to excel one another
    in martial atchievements. It was thought, that, in the <i>hall of clouds</i>, every one had a
    ſeat, raiſed above others, in proportion as he excelled them, in valour, when he lived. </p>

   <p class="noindent"> There are ſome ſtones ſtill to be ſeen in the north, whick were erected as memorials of ſome
    remarkable tranſactions between the ancient chiefs. There are generally found, beneath them,
    ſome piece of arms, and a bit of half-burnt wood. The cauſe of placing the laſt there is not
    mentioned in tradition. </p>
   </div><div id="note_idm45753334816464" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">
   <p class="noindent"> The erecting of his ſtandard on the bank of Lubar, was the ſignal which Fingal, in the
    beginning of the book, promiſed to give to the chiefs, who went to conduct Ferad-artho to the
    army, ſhould he himſelf prevail in battle. This ſtandard here is called, the <i>ſun-beam</i>.
    The reaſon of this appellation, I gave in my notes on the poem intitled Fingal. </p>
   </div><div id="note_idm45753334812144" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">
   <p class="noindent"> The ſcene is changed to the valley of Lona, whither Sulmalla had been ſent, by Cathmor,
    before the battle. Clonmal, an aged bard, or rather druid, as he ſeems here to be endued with a
    preſcience of events, had long dwelt there, in a cave. This ſcene is calculated to throw a
    melancholy gloom over the mind. </p>
   </div><div id="note_idm45753334807776" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">
   <p class="noindent"> Cathmor had promiſed, in the ſeventh book, to come to the cave of Clonmal, after the battle
    was over. </p>
   </div><div id="note_idm45753334802368" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">
   <p class="noindent"> Tradition relates, that Oſſian, the next day after the deciſive battle between Fingal and
    Cathmor, went to find out Sul-malla, in the valley of Lona, His addreſs to her follows :</p>
   <span class="quote">
    <p class="noindent">“Awake thou daughter of Conmor, from the fern-ſkirted cavern of Lona. Awake, thou ſun-beam in
     deſarts ; warriors one day muſt fail. They move forth, like terrible lights ; but, often, their
     cloud is near. Go to the valley of ſtreams, to the wandering of herds, on Lumon; there dwells,
     in his lazy miſt, the man of many days. But he is unknown, Sulmalla, like the thiſtle of the
     rocks of roes; it ſhakes its grey beard, in the wind, and falls, unſeen of our eyes. Not ſuch
     are the kings of men, their departure is a meteor of fire, which pours its red courſe, from the
     deſart, over the boſom of night.</p>
    <p class="noindent">“He is mixed with the warriors of old, thoſe fires that have hid their heads. At times ſhall
     they come forth in ſong. Not forgot has the warrior failed. He has not ſeen, Sul-malla, the
     fall of a beam of his own: no fair-haired ſon, in his blood, young troubler of the field. I am
     lonely, young branch of Lumon, I may hear the voice of the feeble, when my ſtrength ſhall have
     failed in years, for young Oſcar has ceaſed, on his field,” — * *</p>
   </span>
   <p class="noindent">Sul-malla returned to her own country, She makes a conſiderable figure in another poem ; her
    behaviour in that piece accounts for that partial regard with which the poet ought to ſpeak of
    her throughout Temora, </p>
   </div><div id="note_idm45753334790528" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">
   <p class="noindent"> Before I finiſh my notes, it may not be altogether improper to obviate an objection, which
    may be made to the credibility of the ſtory of Temora. It may be aſked, whether it is probable,
    that Fingal could perform ſuch actions as are aſcribed to him in this book, at an age when his
    grandſon, Oſcar, had acquired ſo much reputation in arms. To this it may be anſwered, that
    Fingal was but very young [book 4th] when he took to wife Ros-crana, who ſoon after became the
    mother of Oſſian. Oſſian was alſo extremely young when he married Ever-allin, the mother of
    Oſcar. Tradition relates, that Fingal was but eighteen years old at the birth of his ſon Oſſian
    ; and that Oſſian was much about the ſame age, when Oſcar, his ſon, was born. Oſcar, perhaps,
    might be about twenty, when he was killed, in the battle of Gabhra, [book 1ſt] ſo the age of
    Fingal, when the deciſive battle was fought between him and Cathmor, was juſt fifty-ſix years.
    In thoſe times of activity and health, the natural ſtrength and vigour of a man was little
    abated, at ſuch an age ; ſo that there is nothing improbable in the actions of Fingal, as
    related in this book. </p>

   <p class="noindent">Olaus Wormius, in the appendix to his Treatiſe de Literatura Runica, has given a particular
   account of the Gothic poetry, commonly called Runic, from <i>Runes</i>, which ſignifies the
   Gothic letters. He informs us that there were no fewer than 136 different kinds of meaſure or
   verſe uſed in their Vyſes ; and though we are accuſtomed to call rhyme a Gothic invention, he
   ſays expreſly, that among all theſe meaſures, rhyme, or correſpondence of final ſyllables, was
   never employed. He analyſes the ſtructure of one of theſe kinds of verſe, that in which the poem
   of Lodbrog, afterwards quoted, is written ; which exhibits a very ſingular ſpecies of harmony, if
   it can be allowed that name, depending neither upon rhyme nor upon metrical feet, or quantity of
   ſyllables, but chiefly upon the number of the ſyllables, and the diſpoſition of the letters. In
   every ſtanza was an equal number of lines: in every line ſix ſyllables. In each diſtich, it was
   requiſite that three words ſhould begin with the ſame letter ; two of the correſponding words
   placed in the firſt line of the diſtich, the third, in the ſecond line. In each line were alſo
   required two ſyllables, but never the final ones, formed either of the ſame conſonants, or ſame
   vowels. As an example of this meaſure, Olaus gives us theſe two Latin lines conſtructed exactly
   according to the above rules of Runic verſe; <span class="quote">
   <span class="line">Chriſtus caput noſtrum</span>
   <span class="line"> Coronet te bonis. </span></span> The initial letters of Chriſtus, Caput, and Coronet, make the
   three correſponding letters of the diſtich. In the firſt line, the firſt ſyllables of Chriſtos
   and of noſtrum ; in the ſecond line, the <i>on</i> in coronet and in bonis make the requiſite
   correſpondence of ſyllables. Frequent inverſions and tranſpoſitions were permitted in this
   poetry; which. would naturally follow from ſuch laborious attention to the collocation of words.

   their love ſongs, which Scheffer has given us in his Lapponia, are a proof that natural
   tenderneſs of ſentiment may be ſound in a country, into which the leaſt glimmering of ſcience has
   never penetrated, To moſt Engliſh readers theſe ſongs are well known by the elegant tranſlations
   of them in the Spectator, No. 366 and 406. I ſhall ſubjoin Scheffer's Latin verſion of one of
   them, which has the appearance of being ſtrictly literal. <span class="quote">Sol, clariſſimum

   ſhews, how great an influence he imagined the ſongs of theſe bards to have over the minds of the
   people; and of what nature he judged that influience to be. The Welch bards were of the ſame
   Celtic race with the Scottish and Irish. </p></div><div id="note_idm45753333935072" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">

   the coaſt, or in a country which is every where interſected with arms of the ſea, one of the
   firſt objeCts of their attention, from the earlieſt time, muſt have been how to traverſe the
   waters. Hence that knowlege of the ſtars, ſo neceſſary for guiding them by night, of which we
   find ſeveral traces in Oſſian's works ; particularly in the beautiful deſcription of Cathmor's
   ſhield, in the 7th book of Temora. Among all the northern maritime nations, navigation was very
   early ſtudied, Piratical incurſions were the chief means they employed for acquiring booty ; and
   were among the firſt exploits which diſtinguiſhed them in the world. Even the ſavage Americans
   were at their firſt diſcovery found to poſſeſs the moſt ſurprizing ſkill and dexterity in
   navigating their immenſe lakes and rivers.</p>

   are no other than the ſhining ſtones or pebbles, known to be frequently found along the weſtern
   coaſt of Scotland. </p></div><div id="note_idm45753333821024" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">

   <p class="noindent">The ſcene of this encounter of Fingal with the ſpirit of Loda is laid in Iniſtore, or the
   iſlands of Orkney ; and in the deſcription of Fingal's landing there, it is ſaid, ``A rock bends
   along the coaſt with all its echoing wood. On the top is the circle of Loda, with the moſſy ſtone
   of power.” In confirmation of Oſſian's topography, it is proper to acquaint the reader that in
   theſe iſlands, as I have been well informed, there are many pillars, and circles of ſtones, ſtill
   remaining, known by the name of the ſtones and circles of Loda, or Loden; to which ſome degree of
   ſuperſtitious regard is annexed to this day. Theſe iſlands, until the year 1468, made a part of
   the Daniſh dominions. Their ancient language, of which there are yet ſome remains among the
   natives, is called the Norſe; and is a dialect, not of the Celtic, but of the Scandinavian
   tongue. The manners and the ſuperſtitions of the inhabitants, are quite diſtinct from thoſe of
   the Highlands and weſtern iſles of Scotland. Their ancient ſongs too, are of a different ſtrain
   and character, turning upon magical incantations and evocations from the dead, which were the
   favourite ſubjects of the old Runic poetry. They have many traditions among them of wars in
   former times with the inhabitants of the weſtern iſlands.</p></div><div id="note_idm45753333673312" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">

   <p class="noindent">There is a remarkable propriety in this compariſon. Tt is intended to explain the effect of
   ſoft and mournful muſic. Armin appears diſturbed at a performance of this kind. Carmor ſays to
   him, “Why burſts the ſigh of Armin? Is there a cauſe to mourn? The ſong comes with its muſic to
   melt and pleaſe the ear. It is like ſoft miſt, &amp;c.” that is, ſuch mournful ſongs have a happy
   effect to ſoften the heart, and to improve it by tender emotions, as the moiſture of the miſt
   refreſhes and nouriſhes the flowers ; whilſt the ſadneſs they occaſion is only tranſient, and
   ſoon diſpelled by the ſucceeding occupations and amuſements of life: “The ſun returns in its
   ſtrength, and the miſt is gone.” </p></div><div id="note_idm45753333554592" class="note hidden" style="display:inline;">
