Colna-dona became no leſs enamoured of Toſcar. An incident, at a hunting party, brings their loves to a happy iſſue. </p></div> <!--  -->

That tract of country between the Firths of Forth and Clyde has been, thro' all antiquity, famous for battles and rencounters, between the different nations, who were poſſeſſed of North and South Britain.

    can be no doubt, that they were originally the ſame people, and deſcended from thoſe Gauls who

    hypotheſis is more rational than the idle fables of ill-informed ſenachies, who bring the
    Caledonians from diſtant countries. The bare opinion of Tacitus, (which, by-the-bye, was only
    ſounded on a ſimilarity of the perſonal figure of the Caledonians to the Germans of his own
    time) tho' it has ſtaggered ſome learned men, is not ſufficient to make us believe, that the
    antient inhabitants of North-Britain were a German colony. A diſcuſſion of a point like this
    might be curious, but could never be ſatisfactory. Periods ſo diſtant are ſo involved in
    obſcurity, that nothing certain can be now advanced concerning them. The light which the Roman
    writers hold forth is too feeble to guide us to the truth, thro' the darkneſs which has
    ſurrounded it. </p></note> <hi rend="sc">From</hi> Col-amon came a bard, from Car-ul, the friend of ſtrangers, He bade us to the feaſt <!--  -->
