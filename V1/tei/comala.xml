   <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
   <p> This poem is valuable on account of the light it throws on the antiquity of Oſſian's
    compoſitions, The Caracul mentioned here is the ſame with Caracalla the ſon of Severus, who in
    the year 211 commanded an expedition againſt the Caledonians, The variety of the meaſure ſhews
    that the poem was originally ſet to muſic, and perhaps preſented before the chiefs upon ſolemn
    occaſions. Tradition has handed down the ſtory more complete than it is in the poem. “Comala,
    the daughter of Sarno king of Iniſtore or Orkney iſlands, fell in love with Fingal the ſon of
    Comhal at a feaſt, to which her father had invited him, [Fingal, B. III.] upon his return from
    Lochlin, after the death of Apandecca. Her paſſion was ſo violent, that ſhe followed him,
    diſguiſed like a youth, who wanted to be employed in his wars. She was ſoon diſcovered by
    Hidallan the ſon of Lamor, one of Fingal's heroes, whoſe love ſhe had ſlighted ſome time before.
    Her romantic paſſion and beauty recommended her ſo much to the king, that he had reſolved to
    make her his wife ; when news was brought him of Caracul's expedition. He marched to ſtop the
    progreſs of the enemy, and Comala attended him. He left her on a hill, within ſight of Caracul's
    army, when he himſelf went to battle, having previouſly promiſed, if he ſurvived, to return that
    night,” The ſequel of the ſtory may be gathered from the poem itſelf. </p>

    <p> Hidallan was ſent by Fingal to give notice to Comala of his return ; he, to revenge himſelf
     on her for ſlighting his love ſome time before, told her that the king was killed in battle. He
     even pretended that he carried his body from the field to be buried in her preſence ; and this
