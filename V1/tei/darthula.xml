 <div><head>ARGUMENT.</head><p> It may not be improper here, to give the ſtory which is the ſoundation of this poem, as it is
    handed down by tradition. Uſnoth lord of Etha, which is probably that part of Argyleſhire which
    is near Loch Eta, an arm of the ſea in Lorn, had three ſons, Nathos, Althos, and Ardan by
    Sliſſáma, the daughter of Semo and ſiſter to the celebrated Cuthullin. The three brothers, when
    very young, were ſent over to Ireland, by their father, to learn the uſe of arms, under their
    uncle, Cuthullin, who made a great figure in that kingdom. They were juſt landed in Ulſter when
    the news of Cuthullin's death arrived. Nathos, though very young, took the command of
    Cuthullin's army, made head againſt Cairbar the uſurper, and defeated him in ſeveral battles.
    Cairbar at laſt having ſound means to murder Cormac the lawful king, the army of Nathos ſhifted
    ſides, and he himſelf was obliged to return into Ulſter, in order to paſs over into
    Scotland.</p><p>Dar-thula, the daughter of Colia, with whom Cairbar was in love, reſided, at that time, in Selama, a caſtle in Ulſter : ſhe ſaw, fell in love, and fled with Nathos; but a ſtorm riſing at ſea, they were unfortunately driven back on that part of the coaſt of Ulſter, where Cairbar was encamped with his army. The three brothers, aſter having defended themſelves, for ſome time, with great bravery, were overpowered and ſlain, and the unſortunate Dar-thula killed herſelf upon the body of her beloved Nathos.</p><p>The poem opens, on the night preceding the death of the ſons of Uſnoth, and brings in, by way of epiſode, what paſſed before. It relates the death of Dar-thula differently from the common tradition ; this account is the moſt probable, as ſuicide ſeems to have been unknown in thoſe early times: for no traces of it are ſound in the old poetry. </p></div> <!--  -->

   was mournful and low, like the ſong of the tomb. Fingal heard it the firſt. The crouded ſighs of
   his boſom roſe. “Some of my heroes are low,” ſaid the grey-haired king of Morven. “I hear the
   ſound of death on the harp. Oſſian, touch the trembling ſtring. Bid the ſorrow riſe ; that their

   its beams. The ſons of Erin appear, like grey rocks, with all their trees, they ſpread along the

   in his ſtrength : nor could Dar-thula ſtay behind. She came with the hero, lifting her ſhining

Then the light of their ſwords gleamed on high. The ranks of Erin yield; as a ridge of dark clouds before a blaſt of wind! Then Cairbar ordered his people, and they drew a thouſand bows. A thouſand arrows flew. The ſons of Uſnoth fell in blood. They fell like three young oaks, which ſtood alone on the hill : The traveller ſaw the lovely trees and wondered how they grew ſo lonely : the blaſt of the deſart came, by night, and laid their green heads low ; next day he returned, but they were withered, and the heath was bare !</p><p><hi rend="sc">Dar-thula</hi> ſtood in ſilent grief, and beheld their fall!

   car-borne chief of Etha ? Haſt thou beheld the halls of Uſnoth ? Or the dark-brown hills of
   Fingal ? My battle would have roared on Morven, had not the winds met Dar-thula. Fingal himſelf
