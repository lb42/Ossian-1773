  <head>ARGUMENT to Book IV.</head>
  <p> The action of the poem being ſuſpended by night, Oſſian takes that opportunity to relate his
   own actions at the lake of Lego, and his courtſhip of Evirallin, who was the mother of Oſcar, and
   had died ſome time before the expedition of Fingal into Ireland. Her ghoſt appears to him, and
   tells him that Oſcar, who had been ſent, the beginning of the night, to obſerve the enemy, was
   engaged with an advanced party, and almoſt overpowered. Oſſian relieves his ſon; and an alarm is
   given to Fingal of the approach of Swaran. The king riſes, calls his army together, and, as he
   had promiſed the preceding night, devolves the command on Gaul the ſon of Morni, while he
   himſelf, after charging his ſons to behave gallantly and defend his people, retires to a hill,
   from whence he could have a view of the battle. The battle joins; the poet relates Oſcar's great
   actions. But when Oſcar, in conjunction with his father, conquered in one wing, Gaul, who was
   attacked by Swaran in perſon, was on the point of retreating in the other. Fingal ſends Ullin his
   bard to encourage him with a war ſong, but notwithſtanding Swaran prevails; and Gaul and his army
   are obliged to give way. Fingal, deſcending from the hill, rallies them again: Swaran deſiſts
   from the purſuit, poſſeſſes himſelf of a riſing ground, reſtores the ranks, and waits the
   approach of Fingal. The king, having encouraged his men, gives the neceſſary orders, and renews
   the battle. Cuthullin, who, with his friend Connal, and Carril his bard, had retired to the cave
   of Tura, hearing the noiſe, came to the brow of the hill, which overlooked the field of battle,
   where he ſaw Fingal engaged with the enemy. He, being hindered by Connal from joining Fingal, who
   was himſelf upon the point of obtaining a complete victory, ſends Carril to congratulate that
   hero on his ſucceſs. </p>

  <head>FINGAL, AN ANCIENT EPIC POEM. In SIX BOOKS, BOOK IV.</head>
  <p><note>
   <p>Fingal being aſleep, and the action ſuſpended by night, the poet introduces the ſtory of his
    courtſhip of Evirallin the daughter of Branno, The epiſode is neceſſary to clear up ſeveral
    paſſages that follow in the poem; at the ſame time that it naturally brings on the action of the
    book, which may be ſuppoſed to begin about the middle of the third night from the opening of the
    poem. This book, as many of Oſſian's other compoſitions, is addreſſed to the beautiful Malvina
    the daughter of Toſcar. She appears to have been in love with Oſcar, and to have affected the
    company of the father after the death of the ſon. </p>
   </note> <hi rend="sc">Who</hi> comes with her ſongs from the hill, like the bow of the ſhowery
   Lena? It is the maid of the voice of love ! The white-armed daughter of Toſcar ! Often haſt thou
   heard my ſong; often given the tear of beauty. Doſt thou come to the wars of thy people? to hear

   ſtreams of reſounding Cona ? My years have paſſed away in battle. My age is darkened with
   grief!</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="sc">Daughter</hi> of the hand of ſnow! I was not ſo mournful and blind. I was not ſo
   dark and forlorn, when Everallin loved me ! Everallin with the dark-brown hair, the white-boſomed
   daughter of Branno! A thouſand heroes ſought the maid, ſhe refuſed her love to a thouſand. The
   ſons of the ſword were deſpiſed : for graceful in her eyes was Oſſian! I went, in ſuit of the
   maid, to Lego's ſable ſurge. Twelve of my people were there, the ſons of ſtreamy Morven ! We came
   to Branno, friend of ſtrangers! Branno of the ſounding mail! “From whence,” he ſaid, “are the
   arms of ſteel? Not eaſy to win is the maid, who has denied the blue-eyed ſons of Erin ! But bleſt
   be thou, O ſon of Fingal! Happy is the maid that waits thee! Tho' twelve daughters of beauty were
   mine, thine were the choice, thou ſon of fame !”</p>
  <p><hi rend="sc">He</hi> opened the hall of the maid, the dark-haired Everallin. Joy kindled in
   our manly breaſts. We bleſt the maid of Branno. “Above us on the hill appeared the people of
   ſtately Cormac. Eight were the heroes of the chief. The heath flamed wide with their arms. There

   there Freſtal the victorious ſtood ; Dairo of the happy deeds: Dala the battle's bulwark in the
   narrow way ! The ſword flamed in the hand of Cormac. Graceful was the look of the hero! Eight
   were the heroes of Oſſian. Ullin ſtormy ſon of-war. Mullo of the generous deeds. The noble, the
   graceful Scelacha, Oglan, and Cerdal the wrathful. Dumariccan's brows of death! And why ſhould
   Ogar be the laſt; ſo wide renowned on the hills of Ardven ?”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="sc">Ogar</hi> met Dala the ſtrong, face to face, on the field of heroes. The battle
   of the chiefs was, like wind, on ocean's foamy waves. The dagger is remembered by Ogar ; the
   weapon which he loved. Nine times he drowned it in Dela's ſide. The ſtormy battle turned. Three
   times I broke on Cormac's ſhield : three times he broke his ſpear. But, unhappy youth of love! I
   cut his head away. Five times I ſhook it by the lock. The friends of Cormac fled. Whoever would
   have told me, lovely maid, when then I ſtrove in battle; that blind, forſaken, and forlorn I now
   ſhould paſs the night; firm ought his mail to have been; unmatched his arm in war !”

   <p> The poet returns to his ſubject. If one could fix the time of the year in which the action of
    the poem happened, from the ſcene deſcribed here, I ſhould be tempted to place it in autumn. The
    trees ſhed their leaves, and the winds are variable, both which circumſtances agree with that
    ſeaſon of the year. </p>
   </note> Lena's gloomy heath, the voice of muſic died away. The unconſtant blaſt blew hard. The
   high oak ſhook its leaves around. Of Everallin were my thoughts, when in all the light of beauty
   ſhe came. Her blue eyes rolling in tears. She ſtood on a cloud before my ſight, and ſpoke with
   feeble voice ! “Riſe, Oſſian, riſe and ſave my ſon; ſave Oſcar prince of men. Near the red oak of
   Luba's ſtream, he fights with Lochlin's ſons.” She ſunk into her cloud again, I covered me with
   ſteel. My ſpear ſupported my ſteps; my rattling armour rung. I hummed, as I was wont in danger,
   the ſongs of heroes of old. Like diſtant thunder Lochlin heard. They fled ; my ſon purſued.”</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="sc">I called</hi> him like a diſtant ſtream. Oſcar return over Lena. “No further
   purſue the foe,” I ſaid, “though Oſſian is behind thee.” He came ; and pleaſant to my ear was
   Oſcar's ſounding ſteel. “Why didſt thou ſtop my hand,” he ſaid, “till death had covered all ? For
   dark and dreadful by the ſtream they met <!-- 7 thy -->

   Our ſwords have conquered ſome. But as the winds of night pour the ocean, over the white ſands of
   Mora, ſo dark advance the ſons of Lochlin, over Lena's ruſtling heath ! The ghoſts of night
   ſhriek afar: I have ſeen the meteors of death. Let me awake the king of Morven, he that ſmiles in
   danger ! He that is like the ſun of heaven, riſing in a ſtorm !”</p>
  <p><hi rend="sc">Fingal</hi> had ſtarted from a dream, and leaned on Trenmor's ſhield ; the
   dark-brown ſhield of his fathers ; which they had lifted of old in war. The hero had ſeen, in his
   reſt, the mournful form of Agandecca. She came from the way of the ocean. She ſlowly, lonely,
   moved over Lena. Her face was pale like the miſt of Cromla. Dark were the tears of her cheek. She
   often raiſed her dim hand from her robe: her robe which was of the clouds of the deſart: ſhe
   raiſed her dim hand over Fingal, and turned away her ſilent eyes! “Why weeps the daughter of
   Starno ?” ſaid Fingal, with a ſigh; “why is thy face ſo pale, fair wanderer of the clouds ?” She
   departed: on the wind of Lena. She left him in the midſt of the night. She mourned the ſons of
   her people, that were to fall by the hand of Fingal.</p>

   : For the faint beam of the morning came over the waters of Ullin. “What do the foes in their
   fear ?” ſaid the riſing king of Morven ; “or fly they through ocean's foam, or wait they the

   Fingal. Pleaſant was the voice of the king of Morven to the warriors of his land. Often had he
   led them to battle ; often returned with the ſpoils of the foe !</p>
  <p>“<hi rend="sc">Come</hi> to battle,” ſaid the king, “ye children of ecchoing Selma ! Come to

   back on the war. Three bards attend the ſon of fame, to bear his words to the chiefs. High on

  <p><hi rend="sc">Joy</hi> riſes in Oſcar's face. His cheek is red. His eye ſheds tears. The ſword
   is a beam of fire in his hand. He came, and ſmiling, ſpoke to Oſſian. “O ruler of the ſight of
   ſteel! my father, hear thy ſon! Retire with Morven's mighty chief. Give me the fame of Oſſian. If
   here I fall : O chief, remember that breaſt of ſnow, the lonely ſun-beam of my love, the
   white-handed daughter of Toſcar ! For, with red cheek from the rock, bending over the ſtream, her
   ſoft hair flies about her boſom, as ſhe pours the ſigh for Oſcar. Tell her I am on my hills, a
   lightly-bounding ſon of the wind; tell her, that in a cloud, I may meet the lovely maid of
   Toſcar.” Raiſe, Oſcar, rather raiſe my tomb. I will not yield the war to thee. The firſt and

   this ſword, this bow, the horn of my deer, within that dark and narrow houſe, whoſe mark is one

   Oſcar, terrible wert thou, my beſt, my greateſt ſon! I rejoiced in my ſecret ſoul, when his ſword
