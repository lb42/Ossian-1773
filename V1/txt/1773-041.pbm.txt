xii PREFACE.
--
In that rude field, where Suecia's chieſs were ſlain,
Or forced to wander o'er the Bothnic main.
Dark was his life, yet undiſturb'd with woes,
But when the memory of defeat aroſe
His proud heart ſtruck his ſide ; he graſpt the ſpear,
And wounded Harold in the vacant air.

{One} daughter only, but of form divine,
The laſt fair beam of the departing line,
Remain'd of Sigurd's race. His warlike ſon
Fell in the ſhock, which overturn'd the throne.
Nor deſolate the houſe ! Fionia's charms
Suſtain'd the glory, which they loſt in arms.
White was her arm, as Sevo's lofty ſnow,
Her boſom fairer, than the waves below,
When heaving to the winds. Her radiant eyes
Like two bright ſtars, exulting as they riſe,
O'er the dark tumult of a ſtormy night
And gladd'ning heav'n, with their majeſtic light,

{In} nought is Odin to the maid unkind
Her form ſcarce equals her exalted mind,
Awe leads her ſacred ſteps where'er they move,
And mankind worſhip, where they dare not love.
But, mix'd with ſoftneſs, was the virgin's pride,
Her heart had feelings, which her eyes deny'd.
Her bright tears ſtarted at another's woes,
While tranſient darkneſs on her ſoul aroſe.

{The} chace ſhe lov'd; when morn, with doubtful beans
Came dimly wandering o'er the Bothnic ſtream,
On Sevo's ſounding ſides, ſhe bent the bow,
And rouz'd his foreſts to his head of ſnow.
Nor mov'd the maid alone; &amp;c.
