_ARGUMENT._
{Fingal}, when very young, making a voyage to the Orkney
Iſlands, was driven, by ſtreſs of weather, into a bay of Scan-
dinavia, near the reſidence of Starno, king of Lochlins.
Starno invites Fingal to a feaſt, Fingal, doubting the faith
of the king, and mindful of a former breach of hoſpitality,
refuſes to go.—Starno gathers together his tribes: Fingal
reſolves to defend himſelf. — Night coming on, Duth-maruno
Propoſes to Fingal, to obſerve the motions of the enemy.—
The king himſelf undertakes the watch. Advancing to-
wards the enemy, he, accidentally, comes to the cave of
Turthor, where Starno had confined Conban-carglas, the
captive daughter of a neighbouring chief. — Her ſtory is im-
perfect, a part of the original being loſt.— Fingal comes to
a place of worſhip, where Starno and his ſon, Swaran, con-
ſulted the ſpirit of Loda, concerning the iſſue of the war.—
The rencounter of Fingal and Swaran.— {Duän} firſt concludes
with a deſcription of the airy hall of Cruth-loda ſuppoſed to
be the Odin of Scandinavia.
