4 CATH-LODA:
---
no diſtant roar of ſtreams! No ſound of the
harp, from the rock ! Come, thou huntreſs of
Lutha, Malvina, call back his ſoul to the bard.
I look forward to Lochlin of lakes, to the
dark, billowy bay of U-thorno, where Fingal
deſcends from Ocean, from the roar of winds.
Few are the heroes of Morven, in a land un-
known !

{Starno} ſent a dweller of Loda, to bid Fin-
gal to the feaſt; but the King remembered the
paſt, and all his rage aroſe, `` Nor Gormal's
moſſy towers, nor Starno ſhall Fingal behold.
Deaths wander, like ſhadows, over his fiery ſoul!
Do I ſorget that beam of light, the white-
handed daughter@2* of kings? Go, ſon of Loda;
his words are wind to Fingal : wind, that, to
and fro, drives the thiſtle, in autumn's duſky
==fearing the valour of Fingal, which he had, more than once,
experienced before, he reſolved to accompliſh by treachery
what he was afraid he ſhould fail in by open force. He in-
vited, therefore, Fingal to a feaſt, at which he intended to
aſſaſſinate him, The king prudently declined to go, and
Starno betook himſelf to arms. The ſequel of the ſtory may
be learned from the poem itſelf.
@2Agandecca, the daughter of Starno, whom her father
killed, on account of her diſcovering to Fingal, a plot laid
againſt his life, Her ſtory is related at large, in the third
book of Fingal.
