DUAN FIRST. 5

vale. Duth-maruno@3, arm of death ! Cromma-
glas, of iron ſhields! Struthmor, dweller of
battle's wing ! Cormar, whoſe ſhips bound on
ſeas, careleſs as the courſe of a meteor, on dark-
rolling clouds! Ariſe, around me, children of
heroes, in a land unknown! Let each look on
his ſhield, like Trenmor, the ruler of wars.
`` Come down, thus Trenmor ſaid, thou dwel-
ler between the harps. Thou ſhalt roll this
ſtream away, or waſte with me in earth.”

{Around} the king they riſe in wrath. No
words come forth : they ſeize their ſpears. Each
ſoul is rolled into itſelf. At length the ſudden
clang is waked, on all their echoing ſhields.
Each takes his hill, by night; at intervals, they
darkly ſtand. Unequal burſts the hum of ſongs,
between the roaring wind !

@3Duth-maruno is a name very famous in tradition. Many
of his great actions are handed down, but the poems, which
contained the detail of them, are long ſince loſt. He lived,
it is ſuppoſed, in that part of the north of Scotland, which is
over againſt Orkney. Duth-maruno, Cromma-glas, Struth-
mor, and Cormar, are mentioned, as attending Comhal, in
his laſt battle againſt the tribe of Morni, in a poem, which is
ſtill preſerved. It is not the work of Oſſian ; the phraſeology
betrays it to be a modern compoſition. It is ſomething like
thoſe trivial compoſitions, which the Iriſh bards forged, under
the name of Oſſian, in the fifteenth and ſixteenth centuries.
Duth-maruno ſignifies, {{black and ſteady}}; Cromma-glas, {{bend-
ing and ſwarthy}}; Struthmor, {{roaring ſtream}} ; Cormar, expert
at ſea.
