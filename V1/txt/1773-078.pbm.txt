DUAN FIRST. 9

haſt failed, at thine own dark ſtreams, father
of Conban-cârgla ! But I behold thee, chief of
Lulan, ſporting by Loda's hall, when the dark-
ſkirted night is rolled along the ſky.—Thou,
ſometimes, hideſt the moon, with thy ſhield.
I have ſeen her dim, in heaven. Thou kindleſt
thy hair into meteors, and faileſt along the
night. Why am I forgot, in my cave, king of

He aſked about her fathers.

cruel treatment, ſhe became diſtracted.

Lyric meaſure, and ſet to muſic, which is wild and ſimple, and
ſo inimitably ſuited to the ſituation of the unhappy lady, that
few can hear it without tears.
