12 CATH-LODA:
--
ing beneath a blaſted tree, two heroes received
his words : Swaran of lakes, and Starno foe of
ſtrangers. On their dun ſhields, they darkly
leaned : their ſpears are forward through night.
Shrill ſounds the blaſt of darkneſs, in Starno's
floating beard.

{They} heard the tread of Fingal. The war-
riors roſe in arms. `` Swaran, lay that wanderer
low,” ſaid Starno, in his pride. `` Take the
ſhield of thy father. It is a rock in war.”—
Swaran threw his gleaming ſpear. It ſtood fixed
in Loda's tree. Then came the foes forward,
with ſwords. They mixed their rattling ſteel.
Through the thongs of Swaran's thield ruſhed
the blade@9 of Luno. The ſhield fell rolling on
earth. Cleft the helmet@10 fell down. Fingal ſtopt
the lifted ſteel. Wrathful ſtood Swaran, un-
armed. He rolled his ſilent eyes; he threw his
ſword on earth. Then, ſlowly ſtalking over the
ſtream, he whiſtled as he went.

{Nor} unſeen of his father is Swaran. Starno
turns away in wrath. His ſhaggy brows wave
dark, above his gathered rage. He ſtrikes Loda's

ways conſiſtent with that generoſity of ſpirit which belongs to
a hero. He takes no advantage of a foe diſarmed.
