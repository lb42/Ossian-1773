14 CATH-LODA:
--
the ſpirits of men! In the end of his cloudy
hall, bends forward Cruth-loda of ſwords. His
form is dimly ſeen, amid his wavy miſt. His
right-hand is on his ſhield. In his left is the
half-viewleſs ſhell. The roof of his dreadful hall
is marked, with nightly fires!

{The} race of Cruth-loda advance, a ridge of
formleſs ſhades. He reaches the ſounding ſhell,
to thoſe who ſhone in war. But, between him
and the feeble, his ſhield riſes, a darkened orb.
He is a ſetting meteor to the weak in arms.
Bright, as a rainbow on ſtreams, came Lulan's
white-boſomed maid.
