_ARGUMENT._
FINGAL returning, with day, devolves the command on Duth-
maruno, who engages the enemy, and drives them over the
ſtream of Turthor. Having recalled his people, he congra-
tulates Duth-maruno on his ſucceſs, but diſcovers, that that
hero had been mortally wounded in the action. —Duth-
maruno dies. Ulin, the bard, in honour of the dead, in-
troduces the epiſode of Colgorm and Strina-dona, which con-
cludes this {{duan}}.
