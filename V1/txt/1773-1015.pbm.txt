of Cuthullin ſhall grow, like the branchy
tree of Cromla. Many battles await thee, O
chief! Many ſhall be the wounds of thy hand !
Bring hither, Oſcar, the deer! Prepare the feaſt
of ſhells. Let our ſouls rejoice after danger,
and our friends delight in our preſence !”

{We} ſat. We feaſted, We ſung. The ſoul
of Cuthullin roſe. The ſtrength of his arm re-
turned. Gladneſs brightened along his face.
Ullin gave the ſong ; Carril raiſed the voice.
I joined the bards, and ſung of battles of the
ſpear. Battles! where I often fought. Now
I fight no more ! The fame of my former deeds
is ceaſed. I ſit ſorlorn at the tombs of my
friends !

{Thus} the night paſſed away in ſong. We
brought back the morning with joy. Fingal
aroſe on the heath, and ſhook his glittering
ſpear. He moved firſt toward the plains of
Lena. We followed in all our arms.

``{Spread} the ſail,” ſaid the king, ``ſeize
the winds as they pour from Lena.” We roſe
on the wave with ſongs. We ruſhed, with joy,
through the foam of the deep.
