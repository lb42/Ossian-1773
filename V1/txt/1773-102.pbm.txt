_CATH-LODA:
DUAN SECOND.
_
``{Where} art thou, ſon of the king,” ſaid
dark-haired Duth-maruno ? `` Where
haſt thou failed, young beam of Selma? He
returns not, from the boſom of night ! Morn-
ing is ſpread on U-thorno. In his miſt is the
ſun, on his hill. Warriors, lift the ſhields, in
my preſence. He muſt not fall, like a fire from
heaven, whoſe place is not marked on the
ground. He comes, like an eagle, from the
ſkirt of his ſqually wind ! In his hand are the
ſpoils of foes. King of Selma, our ſouls were
ſad !”

`` {Near} us are the foes, Duth-maruno. They
come forward, like waves in miſt, when their
foamy tops are ſeen, at times, above the low-
ſailing vapour. The traveller ſhrinks on his
journey ; he knows not whither to fly. No
trembling travellers are we ! Sons of heroes call
forth the ſteel. Shall the ſword of Fingal ariſe,
or ſhall a warrior lead ?”
