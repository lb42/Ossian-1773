_LATHMON:
A
POEM._
{Selma}, thy halls are ſilent. There is no
ſound in the woods of Morven. The wave
tumbles alone on the coaſt. The ſilent beam of
the ſun is on the field. The daughters of Mor-
ven come forth, like the bow of the ſhower;
they look towards green Erin for the white ſails
of the king. He had promiſed to return, but
the winds of the north aroſe !

{Who} pours from the eaſtern hill, like a ſtream
of darkneſs? It is the hoſt of Lathmon. He has
heard of the abſence of Fingal. He truſts in
the wind of the north. His ſoul brightens with
joy. Why doſt thou come, O Lathmon ? The
mighty are not in Selma. Why comeſt thou
with thy forward ſpear ? Will the daughters of
Morven fight? But ſtop, O mighty ſtream, in
thy courſe! Does not Lathmon behold theſe
ſails? Why doſt thou vaniſh, Lathmon, like the
miſt of the lake? But the ſqually ſtorm is behind
thee; Fingal purſues thy ſteps !
