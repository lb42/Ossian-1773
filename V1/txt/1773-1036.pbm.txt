is in the ſong. The people behold thee, and
bleſs the departure of mighty Morni. Why
didſt thou not reſt in thine age? The foe will
vanith before Fingal !

{Son} of Comhal, replied the chief, the
ſtrength of Morni's arm has failed. I attempt
to draw the ſword of my youth, but it remains
in its place. I throw the ſpear, but it falls ſhort
of the mark. I feel the weight of my ſhield.
We decay like the graſs of the hill : our ſtrength
returns no more. I have a ſon, O Fingal, his
ſoul has delighted in Morni's deeds; but his
ſword has not been lifted againſt a foe, neither
has his fame begun. I come with him to war;
to direct his arm in fight. His renown will be
a light to my ſoul, in the dark hour of my de-
parture. O that the name of Morni were forgot
among the people! that the heroes would only
ſay, ``Behold the father of Gaul !”

{King} of Strumon, Fingal replied, Gaul ſhall
lift the ſword in fight. But he ſhall lift it before
Fingal; my arm ſhall defend his youth. But
reſt thou in the halls of Selma ; and hear of our
renown. Bid the harp to be ſtrung ; and the voice
of the bard to ariſe, that thoſe who fall may re-
joice in their fame; and the ſoul of Morni
brighten with joy. Oſſian ! thou haſt fought in
