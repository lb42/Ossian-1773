338 _ LATH MO N:

battles: the blood of ſtrangers is on thy ſpear :
thy courſe be with Gaul, in the ſtrife; but de-
part not from the ſide of Fingal! leſt the foe
ſhould find you alone, and your fame fail in my
preſence.

I saw @5 Gaul in his arms; my ſoul was mixed
with his. The fire of the battle was in his eyes!
he looked to the ſoe with joy. We ſpoke the
words of friendſhip in ſecret; the lightning of
our ſwords poured together ; for we drew them
behind the wood, and tried the ſtrength of our
arms on the empty air.

{Night} came down on Morven. Fingal ſat
at the beam of the oak. Morni ſat by his ſide
with all his grey waving locks. Their words
were of other times, of the mighty deeds of their
fathers. Three bards, at times, touched the
harp: Ullin was near with his ſong. He ſung
of the mighty Comhal ; but darkneſs gathered @6

@5 Oſſian ſpeaks. The contraſt between the old and young
heroes is ſtrongly marked. The circumſtance of the latter's
drawing their ſwords is well imagined, and agrees with the
impatience of young ſoldiers, juſt entered upon action.
@6 Ullin had choſen ill the ſubject of his ſong. The {{dark-
neſs which gathered on Morni's brow}}, did not proceed from any
diſlike he had to Comhal's name, though they were foes, but
from his fear that the ſong would awaken Fingal to a remem-
brance of the feuds which had ſubſiſted of old between the
families. Fingals ſpeech on this occaſion abounds with ge-
neroſity and good ſenſe.
