They paſs like a ſhade away. But the fame of
Oſſian ſhall riſe! His deeds ſhall be like his
fathers. Let us ruſh in our arms; ſon of Morni,
let us ruſh to fight. Gaul! if thou ſhouldſt
return, go to Selma's lofty Hall. Tell to
Evirallin that I fell with fame; carry this
ſword to Pranno's daughter. Let her give it
to Oſcar, when the years of his youth ſhall
ariſe,”

``{Son} of Fingal,” Gaul replied with a ſigh
`` ſhall I return after Oſſian is low ? What would
my father ſay, what Fingal the king of men ?
The feeble would turn their eyes and ſay,
``Behold Gaul who left his friend in his blood !”
Ye ſhall not behold me, ye feeble, but in the
midſt of my renown. Oſſian! I have heard
from my father the mighty deeds of heroes ;
their mighty deeds when alone; for the ſoul
increaſes in danger.”

`` Son of Morni,” I replied and ſtrode before
him on the heath, ``our fathers ſhall praiſe our
yalour, when they mourn our fall. A beam of
gladneſs ſhall riſe on their ſouls, when their eyes
are full of tears. They will ſay, `` Our ſons
have not fallen unknown : they ſpread death
around them.” But why ſhould we think of the
narrow houſe ? The ſword defends the brave.
