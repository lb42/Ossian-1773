18 CATH-LODA:

@010 {The} deeds of old, ſaid Duth-maruno, are
like paths to our eyes, O Fingal. Broad-ſhielded
Trenmor, is ſtill ſeen, amidſt his own dim years.
Nor feeble was the ſoul of the king. There, no
dark deed wandered in ſecret. From their hun-
dred ſtreams came the tribes, to graſſy Colglan-
crona. Their chiefs were before them. Each
ſtrove to lead the war. Their ſwords were often
half-unſheathed. Red rolled their eyes of rage.

@010 In this ſhort epiſode we have a very probable account
given us, of the origin of monarchy in Caledonia. The {Caël}
or Gauls, who poſeſſed the countries to the north of the Firth
of Edinburgh, were, originally, a number of diſtinct tribes,
or clans, each ſubject to its own chief, who was free and in-
dependent of any other power. When the Romans invaded
them, the common danger might, perhaps, have induced
thoſe {reguli} to join together, but, as they were unwilling to
yield to the command of one of their own number, their battles
were ill-conducted, and, conſequently, unſucceſsful. Tren-
mor was the firſt who repreſented to the chiefs, the bad conſe-
quences of carrying on their wars in this irregular manner,
and adviſed, that they themſelves ſhould alternately lead in
battle. They did ſo, but they were unſucceſsful. When it
came to Trenmor's turn, he totally defeated the enemy, by
his ſuperior valour and conduct, which gained him ſuch an
intereſt among the tribes, that he, and his family after him,
were regarded as kings; or to uſe the poet's expreſſion, {the
words of power ruſhed forth from Selma of kings}. The regal
authority, however, except in time of war, was but inconſi-
derable; for every chief, within his own diſtrict, was abſo-
lute and independent. From the ſcene of the battle in this
epiſode, (which was in the valley of Crona, a little to the
north of Agricola's wall) I ſhould ſuppoſe, that the enemies
of the Caledonians were the Romans, or provincial Britons.
