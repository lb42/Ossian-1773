--
ſhield of Gormar who fell beneath thy ſpear.
The aged heroes will rejoice beholding the deeds
of their ſons.”

Such were our words on the plain, when Sul-
math @9 came to car-borne Lathmon : Sulmath
chief of Dutha at the dark-rolling ſtream of
Duvranna @10. ``Why doſt thou not ruſh, ſon of
Nu&auml;th, with a thouſand of thy heroes? Why
doſt thou not deſcend with thy hoſt, before the
warriors fly ? Their blue arms are beaming to
the riſing light, and their ſteps are before us on
the heath !”

``{Son} of the feeble hand,” ſaid Lathmon,
`` ſhall my hoſt deſcend ! They are but two,
ſon of Dutha; ſhall a thouſand lift their ſteel !
Nu&auml;th would mourn, in his hall, for the depar-
ture of his fame. His eyes would turn from
Lathmon, when the tread of his feet approached.
Go thou to the heroeſteps of Oſſian. His fame
is worthy of my ſteel! let us contend in
fight.”

land, which falls into the ſea at Banff, ſtill retains the
name of Duvran. If that is meant in this paſſage, Lath-
mon muſt have been a prince of the Pictiſh nation, or thoſe
Caledonians who inhabited of old the eaſtern coaſt of Scot-
