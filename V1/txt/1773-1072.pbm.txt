renown grows on the fall of the haughty. The
light of my ſteel pours on the proud in arms.
The battle comes; and the tombs of the valiant

renowned ; the departure of my ſoul ſhall be a
ſtream of light. Lathmon ! retire to thy place!
Turn thy battles to other lands! The race of
Morven are renowned ; their foes are the ſons of
the unhappy !”
