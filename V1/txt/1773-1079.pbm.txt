_ARGUMENT._
It may not be improper here, to give the ſtory which is the
ſoundation of this poem, as it is handed down by tradition,
Uſnoth lord of Etha, which is probably that part of Argyle-
ſhire which is near Loch Eta, an arm of the ſea in Lorn, had
three ſons, Nathos, Althos, and Ardan by Sliſſ&aacute;ma, the
daughter of Semo and ſiſter to the celebrated Cuthullin.
The three brothers, when very young, were ſent over to Ire-
land, by their father, to learn the uſe of arms, under their
uncle, Cuthullin, who made a great figure in that king-
dom. They were juſt landed in Ulſter when the news of
Cuthullin's death arrived. Nathos, though very young,
took the command of Cuthullin's army, made head againſt
Cairbar the uſurper, and defeated him in ſeveral battles.
Cairbar at laſt having ſound means to murder Cormac the
lawful king, the army of Nathos ſhifted ſides, and he him-
ſelf was obliged to return into Ulſter, in order to paſs over
into Scotland.

Dar-thula, the daughter of Colia, with whom Cairbar
was in love, reſided, at that time, in Selama, a caſtle in
Ulſter : ſhe ſaw, fell in love, and fled with Nathos; but a
ſtorm riſing at ſea, they were unfortunately driven back on
that part of the coaſt of Ulſter, where Cairbar was encamped
with his army. The three brothers, aſter having defended
themſelves, for ſome time, with great bravery, were over-
powered and ſlain, and the unſortunate Dar-thula killed
herſelf upon the body of her beloved Nathos.

The poem opens, on the night preceding the death
of the ſons of Uſnoth, and brings in, by way of epiſode,
what paſſed before. It relates the death of Dar-thula dif-
ferently from the common tradition ; this account is the moſt
probable, as ſuicide ſeems to have been unknown in thoſe
early times: for no traces of it are ſound in the old poetry.
