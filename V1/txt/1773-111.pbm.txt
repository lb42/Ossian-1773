20 CATH-LODA:
--
ſhields, are the deeds of our fathers. But who
ſhall now lead the war, before the race of kings?
Miſt ſettles on theſe four dark hills : within it
let each warrior ſtrike his ſhield. Spirits may
deſcend in darkneſs, and mark us for the war.”

{They} went, each to his hill of miſt. Bards
marked the ſounds of the ſhields. Loudeſt rung
thy boſs, Duth-maruno. Thou muſt lead in
war!

{Like} the murmur of waters, the race of U-
thorno came down. Starno led the battle, and
Swaran of ſtormy iſles. They looked forward
from iron ſhields, like Cruth-loda fiery-eyed,
when he looks from behind the darkened moon,
and ſtrews his ſigns on night. The foes met by
Turthor's ſtream. They heaved like ridgy waves.
Their echoing ſtrokes are mixed. Shadowy
death flies over the hoſts. They were clouds of
hail, with ſqually winds in their ſkirts. Their
==
country, for Morna's behaviour was, according to him, ſo
void of all decency and virtue, that it cannot be ſuppoſed,
they had choſen her for their {{guiding ſtar}}, The poem conſiſts
of many ſtanzas. The language is figurative, and the num-
bers harmonious ; but the piece is ſo full of anachroniſms, and
ſo unequal in its compoſition, that the author, moſt undoubt-
edly, was either mad, or drunk, when he wrote it. It is wor-
thy of being remarked, that Comhal is, in this poem, very
often called, {{Comhal na h'Albin}}, or {{Comhal of Albion}}, which
ſufficiently demonſtrates, that the allegations of Keating and
O'Flaherty, concerning {{Fion Mac-Comnal}}, are but of late in-
vention.
