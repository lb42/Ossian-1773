364 DAR-THULA:

would tremble in his halls, and peace dwell
round the lovely Dar-thula. But why doſt thou
fall, my ſoul? The ſons of Uſnoth may pre-
vail!”

``{And} they will prevail, O Nathos!” ſaid the
riſing ſoul of the maid. ``Never ſhall Dar-
thula behold the halls of gloomy Cairbar. Give
me thoſe arms of braſs, that glitter to the
paſſing meteor. I ſee them dimly in the dark-
boſomed ſhip. Dar-thula will enter the battle
of ſteel. Ghoſt of the noble Colla ! do I behold
thee on that cloud? Who is that dim beſide
thee? Is it the car-borne Truthil ? Shall I be-
hold the halls of him that ſlew Sel&aacute;ma's chief ?
No: I will not behold them, ſpirits of my
love !”

Joy roſe in the face of Nathos, when he heard
the white-boſomed maid. `` Daughter of Se-
l&aacute;ma ! thou ſhineſt along my ſoul. Come, with
thy thouſands, Cairbar ! the ſtrength of Nathos
is returned ! Thou, O aged Uſnoth, ſhalt not
hear that thy ſon has fled. I remember thy
words on Etha; when my ſails began to riſe :
when I ſpread them towards Erin, towards the
moſſy walls of Tura! ``Thou goeſt,” he ſaid,
``O Nathos, to the king of ſhields! Thou goeſt
to Cuthullin, chief of men, who never fled from
--
danger.
