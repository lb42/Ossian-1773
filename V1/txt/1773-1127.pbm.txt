368 DAR-THULA:
--
duſky night came down. His people watch on
Lena's plain. They lift ten thouſand ſwords.”
``And let them lift ten thouſand ſwords,” ſaid
Nathos with a ſmile. ``The ſons of car-borne
Uſnoth will never tremble in danger ! Why doſt
thou roll with all thy foam, thou roaring ſea of
Erin? Why do ye ruſtle, on your dark wings,
ye whiſtling ſtorms of the ſky? Do ye think,
ye ſtorms, that ye keep Nathos on the coaſt ?
No : his ſoul detains him, children of the night!
Althos! bring my father's arms : thou ſeeſt
them beaming to the ſtars. Bring the ſpear
of Semo @18. It ſtands in the dark-boſomed
ſhip !”

{He} brought the arms. Nathos covered his
limbs, in all their ſhining ſteel. The ſtride of
the chief is lovely. The joy of his eyes was
terrible. He looks towards the coming of Cair-
bar. The wind is ruſtling in his hair. Dar-
thula is ſilent at his ſide. Her look is fixed on
the chief. She ſtrives to hide the riſing ſigh.
Two tears ſwell in her radiant eyes !

@18 Semo was grandfather to Nathos by the mother's ſide,
The ſpear mentioned here was given to Uſnoth on his mar-
riage, it being the cuſtom then for the father of the lady to
give his arms to his ſon-in-law,

``ALTHOS!"
