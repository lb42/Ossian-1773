_ARGUMENT._
Cuthullin, after the arms of Fingal had expelled Swaran from
Ireland, continued to manage the affairs of that kingdom
as the guardian of Cormac, the young king. In the third
year of Cuthullin's adminiſtration, Torlath, the ſon of Can-
tela, rebelled in Connaught; and advanced to Temora to
dethrone Cormac. Cuthullin marched againſt him, came
up with him at the lake of Lego, and totally defeated his
forces. Torlath fell in battle by Cuthullin's hand ; but as
he too-eagerly preſſed on the enemy, he was mortally
wounded. The affairs of Cormac, though, for ſometime,
ſupported by Nathos, as mentioned in the preceding poem,
fell into confuſion at the death of Cuthullin. Cormac him-
ſelf was ſlain by the rebel Cairbar; and the re-eſtabliſh-
ment of the royal family of Ireland by Fingal, furniſhes the
ſubject of the epic poem of Temora.
