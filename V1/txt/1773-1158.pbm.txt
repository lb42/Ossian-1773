the car-borne Cormac. ``The winds detain thy
ſails. Thy blue waters roll around thee. But
Cormac is not alone. The ſon of Semo fights
his wars! Semo's ſon his battles fights ! the ter-
ror of the ſtranger ! He that is like the vapour
of death, ſlowly borne by ſultry winds. The
ſun reddens in its preſence: The people fall
around.”

{Such} was the ſong of Carril, when a ſon of
the foe appeared. He threw down his pointleſs
ſpear. He ſpoke the words of Torlath ! Tor-
lath, chief of heroes, from Lego's ſable ſurge!
He that led his thouſands to battle, againſt car-
borne Cormac. Cormac who was diſtant far, in
Temora's @2 ecchoing halls: he learned to bend
the bow of his fathers; and to lift the ſpear.
Nor long didſt thou lift the ſpear, mildly-ſhining
beam of youth! death ſtands dim behind thee,
like the darkened half of the moon, behind its
growing light ! Cuthullin roſe before the bard @3,
that came from generous Torlath. He offered

@2 The royal palace of the Iriſh kings; Teamhrath, accord-
ng to ſome of the bards.
@3 The bards were the heralds of ancient times; and their
perſons were ſacred on account of their office. In later times
they abuſed that privilege ; and as their perſons were invio-
lable, they ſatyriſed and lampooned ſo freely thoſe who were
not liked by their patrons, that they became a public nuiſance.
Screened under the character of heralds, they groſly abuſed the
enemy when he would not accept the terms they offered.
