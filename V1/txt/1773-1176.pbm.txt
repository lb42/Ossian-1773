Thy ſoul is an unextinguiſhed fire. Why fight
we not on the plain, and let our hoſts behold
our deeds? Let them behold us like roaring
waves, that tumble round a rock : the mariners
haſten away, and look on their ſtrife with
fear.

``{Thou} riſeſt, like the ſun, on my ſoul,”
replied the ſon of Semo. ``Thine arm is
mighty, O Torlath ! and worthy of my wrath.
Retire, ye men of Ullin, to Slimora's ſhady ſide.
Behold the chief of Erin, in the day of his fame.
Carril! tell to mighty Connal, if Cuthullin muſt
fall, tell him I accuſed the winds, which roar on
Togorma's waves. Never was he abſent in battle,
when the ſtrife of my fame aroſe. Let his ſword
be before Cormac, like the beam of heaven.
Let his counſel ſound in Temora, in the day
of danger !

{He} ruſhed, in the ſound of his arms, like the
terrible ſpirit of Loda@12, when he comes, in
the roar of a thouſand ſtorms, and ſcatters battles
from his eyes. He ſits on a cloud over Lochlin's
ſeas. His mighty hand is on his ſword. Winds

@12 Loda, in the third book of Fingal, is mentioned as a
place of worſhip in Scandinavia : by the {{ſpirit of Loda}}, the poet
probably means Odin, the great deity of the northern nations.
He is deſcribed here with all his terrors.
