386 The DEATH of CUTHULLIN:
--
lift his flaming locks! The waining moon half-
lights his dreadful face. His features blended in
darkneſs ariſe to view. So terrible was Cuthullin
in the day of his fame. Torlath fell by his hand.
Lego's heroes mourned. They gather around
the chief, like the clouds of the deſart. A thou-
ſand ſwords roſe at once; a thouſand arrows
flew; but he ſtood like a rock in the midſt of a
roaring ſea. They fell around. He ſtrode in
blood. Dark Slimora ecchoed wide. The ſons
of Ullin came. The battle ſpread over Lego.
The chief of Erin overcame. He returned
over the field with his fame. But pale he
returned ! The joy of his face was dark. He
rolled his eyes in ſilence. The ſword hung,
unſheathed, in his hand. His ſpear bent at every
ſtep!

``{Carril},” ſaid the chief in ſecret, ``the
ſtrength of Cuthullin fails. My days are with
the years that are paſt. No morning of mine
ſhall ariſe. They ſhall ſeek me at Temora, but
I ſhall not be ſound. Cormac will weep in his
hall, and ſay, `` Where is Erin's chief?” But my
name is renowned ! my fame in the ſong of
bards. The youth will ſay in ſecret, O let me
die as Cuthullin died. Renown cloathed him
like a robe. The light of his fame is great.
