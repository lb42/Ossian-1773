388 The DEATH of CUTHULLIN:
--

{By} the dark rolling waves of Lego they raiſed
the hero's tomb. Lu&auml;th @15, at a diſtance, lies.
The ſong of bards roſe over the dead.

`` {Blest} @16 be thy ſoul, ſon of Semo. Thou
wert mighty in battle. Thy ſtrength was like
the ſtrength of a ſtream : thy ſpeed like the
eagle's wing. Thy path in battle was terrible :

the maſter. This was not peculiar to the ancient Scots, for we
find it practiſed by many other nations in their ages of he-

Sky, to which Cuthullin commonly bound his dog Luath. The
ſtone goes by his name to this day.
@16 This is the ſong of the bards over Cuthullin's tomb. Every
ſtanza cloſes with ſome remarkable title of the hero, which
was always the cuſtom in funeral elegies.
