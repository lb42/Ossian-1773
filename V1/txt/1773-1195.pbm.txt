_ARGUMENT._
Fingal, on his return from Ireland, after he had expelled
Swaran from that kingdom, made a feaſt to all his heroes :
he forgot to invite Ma-ronnan and Aldo, two chiefs,
who had not been along with him in his expedition.
They reſented his neglect; and went over to Erragon king
of Sora, a country of Scandinavia, the declared enemy of
Fingal. The valour of Aldo ſoon gained him a great repu-
tation in Sora: and Lorma the beautiful wife of Erragon
fell in love with him. He ſound means to eſcape with her,
and to come to Fingal, who reſided then in Selma on the
weſtern coaſt. Erragon invaded Scotland, and was ſlain in
battle by Gaul the ſon of Morni, after he had rejected terms
of peace offered him by Fingal. In this war Aldo fell, in
a ſingle combat, by the hands of his rival Erragon; and
the unfortunate Lorina afterwards died of grief.
