_THE
BATTLE of LORA:
A
POEM._
{Son} of the diſtant land, who dwelleſt in the
ſecret cell! do I hear the ſound of thy
grove? Or is it thy voice of ſongs ? The torrent
was loud in my ear; but I heard a tuneful
voice. Doſt thou praiſe the chiefs of thy land:
or the ſpirits@1 of the wind? But, lonely dweller
of rocks ! look thou on that heathy plain. Thou
ſeeſt green tombs, with their rank, whiſtling
graſs : With their ſtones of moſſy heads. Thou
ſeeſt them, ſon of the rock, but Oſſian's eyes
have failed.

{A mountain-stream} comes roaring down
and ſends its waters round a green hill. Four
moſſy ſtones, in the midſt of withered graſs, rear
their heads on the top. Two trees, which the
ſtorms have bent, ſpread their whiſtling branches
