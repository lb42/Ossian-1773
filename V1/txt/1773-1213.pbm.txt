398 The BATTLE of LORA:
--
daughter of Fingal! Let her bid the king of
Sora to our feaſt, to Selma's ſhaded wall. Offer
him, O Boſmina, the peace of heroes, and the
wealth of generous Aldo. Our youths are far
diſtant. Age is on our trembling hands !”

{She} came to the hoſt of Erragon, like a beam
of light to a cloud. In her right hand was ſeen
a ſparkling ſhell. In her left an arrow of gold.
The firſt, the joyful mark of peace! The latter,
the ſign of war. Erragon brightened in her
preſence as a rock, before the ſudden beams of
the ſun; when they iſſue from a broken cloud,
divided by the roaring wind !

``{Son} of the diſtant Sora,” began the mildly
bluſhing maid. `` Come to the feaſt of Morven's
king, to Selma's ſhaded walls. Take the peace
of heroes, O warrior ! Let the dark ſword reſt
by thy ſide. Chuſeft thou the wealth of Kings ?
Then hear the words of generous Aldo. He
gives to Erragon an hundred ſteeds, the children
of the rein: an hundred maids from diſtant
lands; an hundred hawks with fluttering wing,
that fly acroſs the ſky. An hundred girdles@6

@6 Sanctified girdles, till very lately, were kept in many
families in the north of Scotland; they were bound about
women in labour, and were ſuppoſed to alleviate their pains,
and to accelerate the birth. They were impreſſed with ſeveral
myſtical figures, and the ceremony of binding them about the
woman's waiſt, was accompanied with words and geſtures which
ſhewed the cuſtom to have come originally from the druids.
