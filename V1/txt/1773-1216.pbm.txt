ſhall alſo be thine, to bind high-boſomed maids.
The friends of the births of heroes. The
cure of the ſons of toil. Ten ſhells ſtudded with
gems ſhall ſhine in Sora's towers: the bright
water trembles on their ſtars, and ſeems to be
ſparkling wine. They gladdened once the kings
of the world@7, in the midſt of their ecchoing
halls. Theſe, O hero, ſhall be thine; or thy
white-boſomed ſpouſe. Lorma ſhall roll her
bright eyes in thy halls; though Fingal loves
the generous Aldo : Fingal ! who never injured
a hero, though his arm is ſtrong !”

`` {Soft} voice of Cona !” replied the king,
``tell him, he ſpreads his feaſt in vain. Let
Fingal pour his ſpoils around me. Let him
bend beneath my power. Let him give me the
ſwords of his fathers : the ſhields of other times ;
that my children may behold them in my halls,
and ſay, ``Theſe are the arms of Fingal.”
``Never ſhall they behold them in thy halls !”
ſaid the riſing pride of the maid. `` They
are in the hands of heroes, who never yield-
ed in war. King of ecchoing Sora ! the ſtorm
is gathering on our hills. Doſt thou not
foreſee the fall of thy people, ſon of the diſtant
land?”
