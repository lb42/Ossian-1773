ſounding ſteps, we ruſh, a gloomy ridge, along:
like the ſhower of a ſtorm, when it pours on a
narrow vale.

{The} king of Morven ſat on his hill. The
ſun-beam of battle flew on the wind. The
friends of his youth are near, with all their
waving locks of age. Joy roſe in the hero's
eyes when he beheld his ſons in war: when he
ſaw us amidſt the lightning of ſwords, mindful
of the deeds of our fathers. Erragon came on,
in his ſtrength, like the roar of a winter ſtream.
The battle falls around his ſteps: death dimly
ſtalks along by his ſide!

``{Who} comes,” ſaid Fingal, `` like the bound-
ing roe, like the hart of ecchoing Cona? His
ſhield glitters on his ſide. The clang of his ar-
mour is mournful. He meets with Erragon in
the ſtrife ! Behold the battle of the chiefs! It is
like the contending of ghoſts in a gloomy ſtorm.
But falleſt thou, ſon of the hill, and is thy white
boſom ſtained with blood? Weep, unhappy
Lorma, Aldo is no more !” The king took the
ſpear of his ſtrength. He was ſad for the fall of
Aldo. He bent his deathful eyes on the foe :
but Gaul met the King of Sora. Who can relate
the fight of the chiefs? The mighty ſtranger
fell !
