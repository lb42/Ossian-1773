402 The BATTLE of LORA:
--
``{Sons} of Cona!” Fingal cried aloud, `` ſtop
the hand of death. Mighty was he that is low.
Much is he mourned in Sora! The ſtranger
will come towards his hall, and wonder why it
is ſo ſilent. The king is fallen, O ſtranger.
The joy of his houſe is ceaſed. Liſten to the
ſound of his woods. Perhaps his ghoſt is mur-
muring there ! But he is far diſtant, on Morven,
beneath the ſword of a foreign foe.” Such were
the words of Fingal, when the bard raiſed the
ſong of peace. We ſtopped our uplifted ſwords.
We ſpared the feeble foe. We laid Erragon in
a tomb. I raiſed the voice of grief. The clouds
of night came rolling down. The ghoſt of
Erragon appeared to ſome. His face was cloudy
and dark ; an half-formed ſigh is in his breaſt.
``Bleſt be thy ſoul, O king of Sora ! thine arm
was terrible in war!”

{Lorma} ſat, in Aldo's hall. She ſat at the
light of a flaming oak. The night came down,
but he did not return. The ſoul of Lorma is
ſad! ``What detains thee, hunter of Cona ?
Thou didſt promiſe to return. Has the deer
been diſtant far? do the dark winds ſigh, round
thee, on the heath? I am in the land of ſtran-
gers, where is my friend, but Aldo? Come from
thy ſounding hills, O my beſt beloved !”
