{Her} eyes are turned toward the gate. She
liſtens to the ruſtling blaſt. She thinks it is Aldo's
tread. Joy riſes in her face! But ſorrow returns
again, like a thin cloud on the moon. `` Wilt
thou not return, my love? Let me behold
the face of the hill. The moon is in the eaſt.
Calm and bright is the breaſt of the lake ! When
ſhall I behold his dogs, returning from the chace ?
When ſhall I hear his voice, loud and diſtant on
the wind ? Come from thy ſounding hills, hunter
of woody Cona !” His thin ghoſt appeared, on
a rock, like a watry beam of feeble light : When
the moon ruſhes ſudden from between two
clouds, and the midnight ſhower is on the field !
She followed the empty form over the heath.
She knew that her hero fell. I heard her ap-
proaching cries on the wind, like the mournful
voice of the breeze, when it ſighs on the graſs of
the cave !

{She} came. She ſound her hero ! Her voice
was heard no more. Silent ſhe rolled her eyes.
She was pale, and wildly ſad! Few were her
days on Cona. She ſunk into the tomb. Fin-
gal commanded his bards; they ſung over the
death of Lorma. The daughters of Morven
mourned her, for one day in the year, when the
dark winds of autumn returned !
