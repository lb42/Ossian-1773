24 CATH-LODA:
--
maid, the ſtately huntreſs of Tormoth wild. But
thou lookeſt careleſs from thy ſteps, high-
boſomed Strina-dona !

{If} on the heath ſhe moved, her breaſt was
whiter than the down of Cana @15 ; if on the ſea-
beat ſhore, than the foam of the rolling ocean.
Her eyes were two ſtars of light. Her face was
heaven's bow in ſhowers. Her dark hair flowed
round it, like the ſtreaming clouds. Thou wert
the dweller of ſouls, white-handed Strina-dona !

{Colgorm} came, in his ſhip, and Corcul-
Suran, king of ſhells. The brothers came,
from I-thorno, to woo the ſun-beam of Tor-
moth wild. She ſaw them in their echoing
ſteel. Her ſoul was fixed on þlue-eyed Col-
gorm. Ul-lochlin's@16 nightly eye looked in, and
ſaw the toſſing arms of Strina-dona.

{Wrathful} the brothers frowned. Their
flaming eyes, in ſilence, met. They turned
away. They ſtruck their ſhields. Their hands
were trembling on their ſwords. They ruſhed
into the ſtrife of heroes, for long-haired Strina-
dona.

@15 The {Cana} is a certain kind of graſs, which grows plen-
tiful in the heathy moraſſes of the north. Its ſtalk is of the
reedy kind, and it carries a tuft of down, very much reſem-
bling cotton. It is exceſſively white, and, conſequently
often introduced by the bards, in their ſimiles concerning the
beauty of women.
@16 Ul-locklin, {{the guide to Lochlin}} ; the name of a ſtar.
