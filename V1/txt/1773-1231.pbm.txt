404 The BATTLE of LORA.
--
Son of the diſtant land @9 ! Thou dwelleſt in
the field of fame ! O let thy ſong ariſe, at times,
in praiſe of thoſe who fell. Let their thin ghoſts
rejoice around thee ; and the ſoul of Lorma
come on a feeble beam @10 : when thou lieſt down
to reſt, and the moon looks into thy cave. Then
ſhalt thou ſee her lovely; but the tear is ſtill
on her cheek !
==
@9 The poet addreſſes himſelf to the Culdee.
@10 Be thou on a moon-beam, O Morna, near the window
of my reſt ; when my thoughts are of peace; and the din of
arms is paſt. {Fingal}, B.I.
