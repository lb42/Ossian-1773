Duth-maruno's tomb. Near him are the ſteps
of his heroes, hunters of the boar. By Tur-

ſhades. The wrathful kings ſtood on two hills ;
they looked forward from their boſſy ſhields.
They looked forward to the ſtars of night, red-

genuine remains of Oſſian, that it took me very little time to
mark them out, and totally to reject them. If the modern
Scotch and Iriſh bards have ſhewn any judgment, it is in
aſcribing their own compoſitions to names of antiquity, for,
by that means, they themſelves have eſcaped that contempt,
which the authors of ſuch futile performances muſt, neceſſa-
rily, have met with, from people of true taſte. I was led into
this obſervation, by an Iriſh poem, juſt now before me. It
concerns a deſcent made by Swaran, king of Lochlin, on Ire-
land, and is the work, ſays the traditional preface prefixed to
it, of {{Oſſian Mac-Fion}}. It however appears, from ſeveral
pious ejaculations, that it was rather the compoſition of ſome
good prieſt, in the fifteenth or ſixteenth century, for he ſpeaks;
with great devotion, of pilgrimage, and more particularly, of
the {{blue-eyed daughters of the convent}}. Religious, however, as
this poet was, he was not altogether decent, in the ſcenes he
introduces between Swaran and the wife of {{Congcullion}}, both of
whom he repreſents as giants. It happening unfortunately,
that {{Congcullion}} was only of a moderate ſtature, his wife with-
out heſitation, preferred Swaran, as a more adequate match
for her own gigantic ſize. From this fatal preference pro-
ceeded ſo much miſchief, that the good poet altogether loſt
ſight of his principal action, and he ends the piece, with an
advice to men, in the choice of their wives, which, however
good it may be, I ſhall leave concealed in the obſcurity of the
original.
