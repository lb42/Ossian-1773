DUAN THIRD. 31

abroad the winds, and marks them, with his
ſigns. Starno foreſaw, that Morven's king was
not to yield in war.

{He} twice ſtruck the tree in wrath. He ruſhed
before his ſon. He hummed a ſurly ſong ; and
heard his hair in wind. Turned @31 from one

joy was in the fall of men. Blood, to him, was
a ſummer ſtream, that brings joy to withered
vales, from its own moſſy rock. He came forth
to the lake Luth-cormo, to meet the tall Col-

It is doing injuſtice to Oſſian, to ſay, that he has not a great
variety of characters.
