34 CATH-LODA:
--
ſhout of the king, like the burſting forth of a
ſquall of wind, from a cloud, by night. We
rejoiced, three days, above the dead, and called
the hawks of heaven. They came, from all
their winds, to feaſt on Annir's foes. Swaran!
Fingal is alone @33, on his hill of night. Let thy
ſpear pierce the king in ſecret; like Annir, my
ſoul ſhall rejoice.

`` {Son} of Annir,” ſaid Swaran, `` I ſhall not
ſlay in ſhades. I move forth in light : the hawks
ruſh from all their winds. They are wont to
trace my courſe : it is not harmleſs thro' war.”

{Burning} roſe the rage of the king. He
thrice raiſed his gleaming ſpear. But, ſtarting,
he ſpared his ſon; and ruſhed into the night.
By Turthor's ſtream a cave is dark, the dwelling
of Conban-carglas. There he laid the helmet of
kings, and called the maid of Lulan, but ſhe
was diſtant far, in Loda's reſounding hall.

{Swelling} in his rage, he ſtrode, to where
Fingal lay alone. The King was laid on his
ſhield, on his own ſecret hill.

@33 Fingal, according to the cuſtom of the Caledonian kings,
had retired to a hill alone, as he himſelf was to reſume the
command of the army the next day. Starno might have ſome
intelligence of the king's retiring, which occaſions his requeſt
to Sweran, to ſtab him ; as he foreſaw, by his art of divina-
tion, that he could not overcome him in open battle.
