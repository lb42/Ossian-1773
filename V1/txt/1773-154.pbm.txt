DUAN THIRD. 35
--
{Stern} hunter of ſhaggy boars! no feeble
maid is laid before thee. No boy, on his ferny
bed, by Turthor's murmuring ſtream. Here is
ſpread the couch of the mighty, from which
they riſe to deeds of death ! Hunter of ſhaggy
boars awaken not the terrible !

{Starno} came murmuring on. Fingal aroſe
in arms. `` Who art thou, ſon of night?”
Silent he threw the ſpear. They mixed their
gloomy ſtrife. The ſhield of Starno fell, cleft
in twain. He is bound to an oak. The early
beam aroſe, It was then Fingal beheld the king.
He rolled a while his ſilent eyes. He thought of
other days, when white-boſomed Agandecca
moved like the muſic of ſongs. He looſed the
thong from his hands. Son of Annir, he ſaid,
retire. Retire to Gormal of ſhells; a beam that
was ſet returns. I remember thy white-bo-
ſomed daughter; dreadful king away ! Go to
thy troubled dwelling, cloudy foe of the lovely !
Let the ſtranger ſhun thee, thou gloomy in the
hall!

A {TALE} of the times of old!
