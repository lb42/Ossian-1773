_ARGUMENT._
This poem is valuable on account of the light it throws on
the antiquity of Oſſian's compoſitions, The Caracul men-
tioned here is the ſame with Caracalla the ſon of Severus,
who in the year 211 commanded an expedition againſt the
Caledonians, The variety of the meaſure ſhews that the
poem was originally ſet to muſic, and perhaps preſented
before the chiefs upon ſolemn occaſions. Tradition has
handed down the ſtory more complete than it is in the
poem. `` Comala, the daughter of Sarno king of Iniſtore
or Orkney iſlands, fell in love with Fingal the ſon of Com-
hal at a feaſt, to which her father had invited him, [Fin-
gal, B. III.] upon his return from Lochlin, after the death
of Apandecca.  Her paſſion was ſo violent, that ſhe fol-
lowed him, diſguiſed like a youth, who wanted to be
employed in his wars. She was ſoon diſcovered by Hidal-
lan the fon of Lamor, one of Fingal's heroes, whoſe love
ſhe had ſlighted ſome time before. Her romantic paſſion and
beauty recommended her ſo much to the king, that he had
reſolved to make her his wife ; when news was brought him
of Caracul's expedition. He marched to ſtop the progreſs
of the enemy, and Comala attended him. He left her
on a hill, within ſight of Caracul's army, when he himſelf
went to battle, having previouſly promiſed, if he ſurvived,
to return that night,” The ſequel of the ſtory may be ga-
thered from the poem itſelf.
