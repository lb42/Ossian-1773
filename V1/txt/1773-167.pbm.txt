40 COMALA:
--
deer at Crona's ſtream, a moſſy bank he ſeemed
through the gloom, but ſoon he bounded away.
A meteor played round his branching horns !
the awful faces+@1 of other times looked from the
clouds of Crona !
%{Dersagrena @2.}
{These} are the ſigns of Fingal's death.
The king of ſhields is fallen! and Caracul pre-
vails. Riſe, Comala @3, from thy rock; daugh-
ter of Sarno, riſe in tears. The youth of thy
love is low ; his ghoſt is on our hills.
%{Melilcoma.}
{There} Comala ſits forlorn! two grey dogs
near ſhake their rough ears, and catch the fly-
ing breeze. Her red check reſts upon her arm,
the mountain wind is in her hair. She turns
her blue eyes toward the fields of his promiſe.
Where art thou, O Fingal, the night is ga-
thering around ?

And the dire form of hoſtile gods appear.
