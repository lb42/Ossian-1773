A DRAMATIC POEM. 41
---
%{Comala.}
{O Carun} @4* of the ſtreams! why do I behold
thy waters rolling in blood? Has the noiſe of
the battle been heard; and ſleeps the king of
Morven? Riſe, moon, thou daughter of the
ſky ! look from between thy clouds, riſe that I
may behold the gleam of his ſteel, on the field
of his promiſe. Or rather let the meteor, that
lights our fathers through the night, come,
with its red beam, to ſhew me the way to
my fallen hero. Who will defend me from ſor-
row ? Who from the love of Hidallan? Long
ſhall Comala look before ſhe can behold Fingal
in the midſt of his hoſt ; bright as the coming
forth of the morning, in the cloud of an early
ſhower.

tains ſtill the name of Carron, and falls into the Forth ſome
miles to the North of Falkirk.

{{&mdash;Genteſque alias cum pelleret armis\
Sedibus, aut victas vilem ſervaret in uſum\
Servitii, hic contenta ſuos defendere fines\
Rema ſecurigeris pr&aelig;tendit m&aelig;nia Scotis :\
Hic ſpe progreſſus poſita, Caronis ad undam\
Terminus Auſonii ſignat divortia regni.}} {Buchanan.}
