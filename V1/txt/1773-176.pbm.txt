A DRAMATIC POEM. 43
--
maid, that I may behold her white arm, her
lovely cheek in her grief.
%{Comala}.
{And} is the ſon of Comhal fallen, chief of the
mournful tale? The thunder rolls on the hill!
The lightning flies on wings of fire! They
frighten not Comala; for Fingal is low. Say,
chief of the mournful tale, fell the breaker of
the ſhields ?
%{Hidallan.}
{The} nations are ſcattered on their hills! they
ſhall hear the voice of the king no more.
%{Comala.}
{Confusion} purſue thee over thy plains !
Ruin overtake thee, thou king of the world !
Few be thy ſteps to thy grave; and let one vir-
gin mourn thee. Let her be like Comala, tear-
ful in the days of her youth. Why haſt thou
told me, Hidallan, that my hero fell? I might
have hoped a little while his return, I might
have thought I ſaw him on the diſtant rock; a
tree might have deceived me with his appear-
ance ; the wind of the hill might have been the
ſound of his horn in mine ear. O that I were
on the banks of Carun! that my tears might be
warm on his cheek !
