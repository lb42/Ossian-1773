44 COMALA;
--
%{Hidallan.}
{He} lies not on the banks of Carun : on Ard-
ven heroes raiſe his tomb, Look on them, O
moon, from thy clouds ; be thy beam bright
on his breaſt, that Comala may behold him in
the light of his armour.
%{Comala.}
{Stop}, ye ſons of the grave, till I behold my
love ! He left me at the chace alone. I knew
not that he went to war. He ſaid he would re-
turn with the night; the king of Morven is
returned ! Why didſt thou not tell me that he
would fall, O trembling dweller of the rock @6!
Thou ſaweſt him in the blood of his youth;
but thou didſt not tell Comala !
%{Melilcoma.}
{What} ſound is that on Ardven? Who is that
bright in the vale? Who comes like the ſtrength
of rivers, when their crouded waters glitter to
the moon ?
==
@6 By the dweller of the rock ſhe means a druid. It is probable
that ſome of the order of the druids remained as late as the
beginning of the reign of Fingal ; and that Comala had con-
ſulted one of them concerning the event of the war with
Caracul.
