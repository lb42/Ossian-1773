A DRAMATIC POEM, 45
--
%{Comala.}
{Who} is it but the foe of Comala, the ſon of
the king of the world! Ghoſt of Fingal! do
thou, from thy cloud, direct Comala's bow.
Let him fall like the hart of the deſart. It is
Fingal in the crowd of his ghoſts. Why doſt
thou come, my love, to frighten and pleaſe
my ſoul ?
%{Fingal.}
{Raise}, ye bards the ſong, raiſe the wars of
the ſtreamy Carun ! Caracul has fled from our
arms along the fields of his pride. He ſets far
diſtant like a meteor, that incloſes a ſpirit of
night, when the winds drive it over the heath,
and the dark woods are gleaming around. I
heard a voice, or was it the breeze of my
hills? Is it the huntreſs of Ardven, the white-
handed daughter of Sarno? Look from thy
rocks, my love ; let me hear the voice of Co-
mala !
%{Comala.}
{Take} me to the cave of thy reſt, O lovely
ſon of death !
--
Fingal.
