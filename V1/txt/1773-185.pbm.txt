46 COMALA:
--
%{Fingal.}
{Come} to the cave of my reſt. The ſtorm
is paſt, the ſun is on our fields. Come to
the cave of my reſt, huntreſs of ecchoing
Ardven!
%{Comala}.
{He} is returned with his fame! I feel the
right hand of his wars! But I muſt reſt be-
ſide the rock till my ſoul returns from my fear !
O let the harp be near! raiſe the ſong, ye
daughters of Morni !
%{Dersagrena.}
{Comala} has ſlain three deer on Ardven, the
fire aſcends on the rock; go to the feaſt of
Comala, king of the woody Morven.
%{Fingal.}
{Rais}, ye ſons of ſong, the wars of the
ſtreamy Carun; that my white-handed maid
may rejoice: while I behold the feaſt of my
love.
%{Bards.}
{Roll}, ſtreamy Carun, roll in joy, the ſons
of battle fled! The ſteed is not ſeen on our
--
fields ;
