_ARGUMENT._

Fingal, returning from an expedition which he had made
into the Roman province, reſolved to viſit Cathulla king
of Iniſtore, and brother to Comala, whoſe ſtory is re-
lated, at large, in the preceding dramatic poem. Upon
his coming in ſight of Carric-thura, the palace of Ca-
thulla, he obſerved a flame on its top, which, in thoſe days,
was a ſignal of diſtreſs. The wind drove him into a bay,
at ſome diſtance from Carric-thura, and he was obliged to
paſs the night on the ſhore. Next day he attacked the army
of Frothal king of Sora, who had beſieged Cathulla in his
palace of Carric-thura, and took Frothal himſelf priſoner,
after he had engaged him in a ſingle combat. The deli-
verance of Carric-thura is the ſubject of the poem, but ſeve-
ral other epiſodes are interwoven with it. It appears from
tradition, that this poem was addreſſed to a Culdee, or one
of the firſt Chriſtian miſſionaries, and that the ſtory of the
{{Spirit of Loda}}, ſuppoſed to be the ancient Odin of Scandi-
navia, was introduced by Oſſian in oppoſition to the Culdee's
doctrine. Be this as it will, it lets us into Oſſian's notions
of a ſuperior being; and ſhews that he was not addicted
to the ſuperſtition which prevailed all the world over, before
the introduction of Chriſtianity.
