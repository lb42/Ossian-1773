_CARRIC-THURA:
A
POEM._

{Hast}@1+ thou left thy blue courſe in hea-
ven, golden-haired ſon of the ſky ! The
weſt has opened its gates ; the bed of thy repoſe
is there, The waves come to behold thy beauty.
They lift their trembling heads. They ſee thee
lovely in thy ſleep; they ſhrink away with fear.
Reſt, in thy ſhadowy cave, O ſun! let thy
return be in joy.

But let a thouſand lights ariſe to the ſound of
the harps of Selma : let the beam ſpread in the
hall, the king of ſhells is returned ! The ſtrife
of Carun is paſt @2*, like ſounds that are no more.
Raiſe the ſong, O bards, the king is returned,
with his fame!

==
@1+ The ſong of Ullin, with which the poem opens, is in a
lyric meaſure. It was uſual with Fingal, when he returned
from his expeditions, to ſend his bards ſinging beſore him.
This ſpecies of triumph is called, by Oſſian, the {{ſong of victory}}.
@2* Oſſian has celebrated the {{ſtrife of Crona}}, in a particular
poem. This poem is connected with it, but it was impoſſible
for the tranſlator to procure that part which relates to Crona,
with any degree of purity.
