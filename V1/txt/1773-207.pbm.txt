54 CARRIC-THURA:
--
{Such} were the words of Ullin, when Fingal
returned from war: when he returned in the
fair bluſhing of youth, with all his heavy locks.
His blue arms were on the hero; like a
light cloud on the ſun, when he moves in his
robes of miſt, and ſhews but half his beams.
His heroes follow the king : the feaſt of ſhells is
ſpread. Fingal turns to his bards, and bids
the ſong to riſe.

{Voices} of ecchoing Cona ! he ſaid, O bards
of other times! Ye, on whoſe ſouls the blue
hoſts of our fathers riſe! ſtrike the harp in my
hall; and let me hear the ſong. Pleaſant is the
joy of grief! it is like the ſhower of ſpring,
when it ſoftens the branch of the oak, and the
young leaf rears its green head. Sing on, O
bards, to-morrow we lift the ſail. My blue
courſe is through the ocean, to Carric-thura's
walls; the moſſy walls of Sarno, where Com&agrave;la
dwelt, There the noble Cathulla, ſpreads the
feaſt of ſhells. The boars of his woods are
many ; the ſound of the chace ſhall ariſe !
