ruſhes ; I hear not the fount of the rock. Afar,
Vinvela @5, afar, I go to the wars of Fingal. My
dogs attend me no more. No more I tread the
hill. No more from on high I ſee thee, fair-
moving by the ſtream of the plain; bright as
the bow of heaven; as the moon on the weſtern
wave.
%{Vinvela.}
{Then} thou art gone, O Shilric ! I am alone
on the hill ! The deer are ſeen on the brow ; void
of fear they graze along. No more they dread
the wind; no more the ruſtling tree. The
hunter is far removed; he is in the field of
graves. Strangers! ſons of the waves! ſpare
my lovely Shilric !
%{Shilric.}
{If} fall I muſt in the field, raiſe high my grave,
Vinvela. Grey ſtones and heaped-up earth,
ſhall mark me to future times. When the hun-
ter ſhall ſit by the mound, and produce his food
at noon, `` Some warrior reſts here,” he will
ſay ; and my fame ſhall live in his praiſe. Re-
member me, Vinvela, when low on earth I lie!
