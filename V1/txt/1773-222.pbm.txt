why art thou on the deſert hill? Why on the
heath alone ?”

`` {Alone} I am, O Shilric! alone in the
winter-houſe, With grief for thee I fell. Shil-
ric, I am pale in the tomb.”

{She} fleets, ſhe fails away ; as miſt before the
wind ! and, wilt thou not ſlay, Vinvela ? Stay
and behold my tears ! fair thou appeareſt, Vin-
vela ! fair thou waſt, when alive |!

{By} the moſſy fountain I will fit; on the top
of the hill of winds. When mid-day is ſilent
around, O talk with me, Vinvela! come on the
light-winged gale ! on the breeze of the deſart,
come! Let me hear thy voice, as thou paſſeſt,
when mid-day is ſilent around !

{Such} was the ſong of Cronnan, on the night
of Selma's joy. But morning roſe in the eaſt ;
the blue waters rolled in light. Fingal bade his
ſails to riſe; the winds cane ruſtling from their
hills. Iniſtore roſe to fight, and Carric-thura's
moſſy towers! But the ſign of diſtreſs was on
their top : the warning flame edged with ſmoke.
The king of Morven ſtruck his breaſt: he
aſſumed, at once, his ſpear. His darkened brow
bends forward to the coaſt: he looks back to
the lagging winds. His hair is diſordered on
his back. The ſilence of the king is terrible !
