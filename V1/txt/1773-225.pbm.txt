60 CARRIC-THURA:
--
{Night} came down on the ſea; Rotha's bay
received the ſhip. A rock bends along the coaſt
with all its ecchoing wood. On the top is the
circle @9* of Loda, the moſſy ſtone of power!
A narrow plain ſpreads beneath, covered with
graſs and aged trees, which the midnight winds,
in their wrath, had torn from the ſhaggy rock.
The blue courſe of a ſtream is there ! the lonely
blaſt of ocean purſues the thiſtle's beard. The
flame of three oaks aroſe: the feaſt is ſpread
around: but the ſoul of the king is ſad, for
Carric-thura's Chief diſtreſt,

{The} wan, cold moon roſe, in the eaſt. Sleep
deſcended on the youths! Their blue helmets
glitter to the beam ; the fading fire decays. But
ſleep did not reſt on the king : he roſe in the
midſt of his arms, and ſlowly aſcended the hill
to behold the flame of Sarno's tower.

{The} flame was dim and diſtant; the moon hid
her red face in the eaſt. A blaſt came from the
mountain, on its wings was the ſpirit of Loda.
He came to his place in his terrors @10+, and ſhook

@9* {{The circle of Loda}} is ſuppoſed to be a place of worſhip
among the Scandinavians, as the ſpirit of Loda is thought to
be the ſame with their god Odin.
@10+ He is deſcribed, in a ſimile, in the poem concerning the
death of Cuchullin.
