64. CARRIC-THURA:
--
Cathulla. When Annir's ſtone @13 of fame aroſe,
Frothal came in his ſtrength. The battle burned
round Carric-thura, and Sarno's moſſy walls.

{Morning} roſe on Iniſtore. Frothal ſtruck
his dark-brown ſhield. His chiefs ſtarted at the
ſound; they ſtood, but their eyes were turned
to the ſea. They ſaw Fingal coming in his
ſtrength; and firſt the noble Thubar ſpoke.
`` Who comes like the ſtag of the deſart, with
all his herd behind him? Frothal, it is a foe! I
fee his forward ſpear. Perhaps it is the king of
Morven, Fingal the firſt of men. His deeds
are well known in Lochlin; the blood of his
foes is in Starno's halls. Shall I aſk the peace @14+
of kings? His ſword is the bolt of heaven!”

{Son} of the feeble hand, ſaid Frothal, ſhall
my days begin in a cloud? Shall I yield before
I have conquered, chief of ſtreamy Tora? The
people would ſay in Sora, Frothal flew forth
like a meteor; but a darkneſs has met him;
and his fame is no more. No: Thubar, I will
never yield ; my fame ſhall ſurround me like
light, No : I will never yield, chief of ſtreamy
Tora !
==
@13 That is, after the death of Annir. To erect the ſtone of
one's fame, was, in other words, to ſay that the perſon was
dead.
@14+ Honourable terms of peace.
