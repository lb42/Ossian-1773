66 CARRIC-THURA:
--
{Fingal} heard the words of the bard; he
came in the ſtrength of his ſteel. They mixed
their deathful ſpears: They raiſed the gleam of
their arms. But the ſword of Fingal deſcended
and cut Frothal's ſhield in twain. His fair ſide
is expoſed ; half bent he foreſees his death.
Darkneſs gathered on Utha's ſoul. The tear
rolled down her cheek. She ruſhed to cover
the chief with her ſhield; but a fallen oak met
her ſteps. She fell on her arm of ſnow; her
ſhield, her helmet flew wide. Her white boſom
heaved to the fight; her dark-brown hair is
ſpread on earth.

{Fingal} pitied the white-armed maid ! he
ſtayed the uplifted ſword. The tear was in the
eye of the king, as, bending forward, he ſpoke.
``King of ſtreamy Sora ! fear not the ſword of
Fingal. It was never ſtained with the blood of
the vanquiſned ; it never pierced a fallen foe.
Let thy people rejoice by thy native ſtreams.
Let the maids of thy love be glad. Why ſhouldeſt
thou fall in thy youth, King of ſtreamy Sora ?”
Frothal heard the words of Fingal, and ſaw
the riſing maid: they @15* ſtood in ſilence, in their
beauty : like two young trees of the plain, when
the ſhower of ſpring is on their leaves, and the
loud winds are laid.
