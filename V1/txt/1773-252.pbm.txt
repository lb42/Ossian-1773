ſteel; but ſad is his darkened brow ! Live the
mighty race of Fingal? or what darkens in
Connal's ſoul @19* ?

%{Connal.}
{They} live. They return from the chace,
like a ſtream of light. The ſun is on their
ſhields. Like a ridge of fire they deſcend the
hill. Loud is the voice of the youth ! the war,
my love, is near ! To-morrow the dreadful
Dargo comes to try the force of our race. The
race of Fingal he defies; the race of battle and
wounds !
%{Crimora.}
{Connal}, I ſaw his ſails like grey miſt on the
dark-brown wave. They ſlowly came to land,
Connal, many are the warriors of Dargo!
%{%Connal.}
{Bring} me thy father's ſhield ; the boſſy, iron
ſhield of Rinyal ; that ſhield like the full-orbed
moon, when the moves darkened through hea-
ven.

@19 Connal, the ſon of Diaran, was one of the moſt famous
heroes of Fingal; he was ſlain in a battle againſt Dargo a
Briton ; but whether by the hand of the enemy, or that of his
miſtreſs, tradition does not determine.
