drove Fingal to Morven's woody land. But
the ſpirit of Loda ſat, in his cloud, behind the

The wounds of his form were not forgot ; he

@21* The ſtory of Fingal and the ſpirit of Loda, ſuppoſed to
be the famous Odin, is the moſt extravagant fiction in all
Oſſian's poems. It is not, however, without precedents in
the beſt poets; and it muſt be ſaid for Oſſian, that he ſays
nothing but what perfectly agreed with the notions of the
times, concerning ghoſts. They thought the ſouls of the
dead were material, and conſequently ſuſceptible of pain.
Whether a proof could be drawn from this paſſage, that
Oſſian had no notion of a divinity, I ſhall leave to others to
determine: it appears, however, that he was of opinion, that
ſuperior beings ought to take no notice of what paſſed
among men.
