_CARTHON:
A
POEM._
{A tale} of the times of old ! The deeds of
days of other years !

{The} murmur of thy ſtreams, O Lora, brings
back the memory of the paſt. The ſound of
thy woods, Garmallar, is lovely in mine ear.
Doſt thou not behold, Malvina, a rock with
its head of heath ? Three aged pines bend from
its face; green is the narrow plain at its feet
there the flower of the mountain grows, and
ſhakes its white head in the breeze. The thiſtle
is there alone, ſhedding its aged beard. Two
ſtones, half ſunk in the ground, ſhew their
heads of moſs. The deer of the mountain avoids
the place, for he beholds a dim ghoſt ſtanding
there@1. The mighty lie, O Malvina, in the nar-
row plain of the rock.
==
@1 It was the opinion of the times, that deer ſaw the ghoſts of
the dead. To this day, when beaſts ſuddenly ſtart without any
apparent cauſe, the vulgar think that they ſee the ſpirits of the
deceaſed.
