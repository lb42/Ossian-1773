--
{A tale} of the times of old ! the deeds of
days of other years !

{Who} comes from the land of ſtrangers, with
his thouſands around him ? the ſun-beam pours
its bright ſtream before him ; his hair meets the
wind of his hills. His face is ſettled from war.
He is calm as the evening beam that looks, from
the cloud of the weſt, on Cona's ſilent vale.
Who is it but Comhal's ſon@2, the king of
mighty deeds! He beholds his hills with joy,
he bids a thouſand voices rife. `` Ye have fled
over your fields, ye ſons of the diſtant land!
The king of the world ſits in his hall, and hears
of his people's flight. He lifts his red eye of
pride ; he takes his father's ſword. Ye have fled
over your fields, ſons of the diſtant land !”

{Such} were the words of the bards, when they
came to Selma's halls. A thouſand lights@3 from
the ſtranger's land roſe, in the midſt of the
people. The feaſt is ſpread around; the night
paſſed away in joy. Where is the noble Cleſs-
&aacute;mmor@4, ſaid the fair-haired Fingal ? Where
is the brother of Morna, in the hour of my joy ?
==
@2 Fingal returns here, from an expedition againſt the Ro-
mans, which was celebrated by Oſſian in a poem called {{the
ſtrife of Crena.}}
@3 Probably wax-lights ; which are often mentioned as car-
ried, among other booty, from the Roman province.
@4 Cleſſamh m&oacute;r, {{mighty deeds}}.
