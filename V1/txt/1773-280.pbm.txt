A P O E M. 79
--
Sullen and dark he paſſes his days in the vale of
ecchoing Lora : but, behold, he comes from the
hill, like a ſteed in his ſtrength, who finds his
companions in the breeze ; and toſſes his bright
mane in the wind. Bleſt be the ſoul of Cleſs-
&aacute;mmor, why ſo long from Selma ?

{Returns} the chief, ſaid Cleſs&aacute;mmor, in the
midſt of his fame? Such was the renown of
Comhal in the battles of his youth. Oſten did
we paſs over Carun to the land of the ſtrangers :
our ſwords returned, not unſtained with blood :
nor did the kings of the world rejoice. Why do
I remember the times of our war? My hair is
mixed with grey. My hand forgets to bend the
bow : I lift a lighter ſpear. O that my joy would
return, as when I firſt beheld the maid ; the
white boſomed daughter of ſtrangers, Moina @6,
with the dark-blue eyes !

{Tell}, ſaid the mighty Fingal, the tale of thy
youthful days. Sorrow, like a cloud on the ſun,
ſhades the ſoul of Cleſ&aacute;mmor. Mournful are
thy thoughts, alone, on the banks of the roar-
ing Lora. Let us hear the ſorrow of thy youth,
and the darkneſs of thy days!

names in this poem derived from the Galic, which is a proof
that the ancient language of the whole iſland was one and th®
ſame.
