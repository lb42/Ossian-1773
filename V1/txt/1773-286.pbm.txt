midſt of thouſands, though the valiant are diſ-

he fell beneath my ſword. The banks of Clutha
heard his fall ; a thouſand ſpears glittered around.
I fought : the ſtrangers prevailed : I plunged
into the ſtream of Clutha. My white ſails roſe
over the waves, and I bounded on the dark-blue
ſea. Moina came to the ſhore, and rolled the
red eye of her tears: her looſe hair flew on the
wind; and I heard her mournful, diſtant cries.
Often did I turn my ſhip ! but the winds of the
Eaſt prevailed. Nor Clutha ever ſince have I ſeen,
nor Moina of the dark brown hair. She fell in
Balclutha, for I have ſeen her ghoſt. I knew her
as ſhe came through the duſky night, along the
murmur of Lora : ſhe was like the new moon,
ſeen through the gathered miſt : when the ſky
pours down its flaky ſnow, and the world is
ſilent and dark.”
