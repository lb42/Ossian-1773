86 CARTHON:
--
ſide : thy ſpear is a pine that defies the ſtorm.
The varied face of the moon is not broader than
thy ſhield. Ruddy is thy face of youth! ſoft
the ringlets of thy hair ! But this tree may fall ;
and his memory be forgot ! The daughter of the
ſtranger will be ſad, looking to the rolling ſea :
the children will ſay, `` We ſee a ſhip ; perhaps
it is the king of Balclutha.” The tear ſtarts
from their mother's eye. Her thoughts are of
him who ſleeps in Morven !”

{Such} were the words of the king, when Ullin
came to the mighty Carthon : he threw down
the ſpear before him ; he raiſed the ſong of
peace. `` Come to the ſeaft of Fingal, Carthon,
from the rolling ſea ! partake of the feaſt of the
king, or lift the ſpear of war ! The ghoſts of our
foes are many : but renowned are the friends of
Morven ! Behold that field, O Carthon ; many
a green hill riſes there, with moſſy ſtones and
ruſtling graſs : theſe are the tombs of Fingal's
foes, the ſons of the rolling ſea !”

`` {Dost} thou ſpeak to the weak in arms!”
ſaid Carthon, `` bard of the woody Morven ? Is
my face pale for fear, ſon of the peaceful ſong ?
Why, then, doſt thou think to darken my ſoul
with the tales of thoſe who fell? My arm has
fought in battle; my renown is known afar.
Go to the feeble in arms, bid them yield to Fin-
--
r gal.
