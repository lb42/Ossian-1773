88 CARTHON:
--
of Carthon ; Fingal took his thouſands to battle,
before the noble Carthon fell, No : bard of the
times to come ! thou thalt not leſſen Fingal's
fame. My heroes will fight the youth, and Fin-
gal behold the war. If he overcomes, I ruſh,
in my ſtrength, like the roaring ſtream of
Cona. Who, of my chiefs, will meet the ſon of
the rolling ſea? Many are his warriors on the
coaſtt : and ſtrong is his aſhen ſpear !

{Cathul} @12 roſe, in his ſtrength, the ſon of
the mighty Lormar : three hundred youths at-
tend the chief, the race @13 of his native ſtreams,
Feeble was his arm againſt Carthon, he ſell; and
his heroes fled. Connal @14 reſumed the battle, but
he broke his heavy ſpear : he lay bound on the
field : Carthon purſued his people.

{Clessammor} ! ſaid the king @@15 of Morven,
where is the ſpear of thy ſtrength? Wilt thou
behold Connal bound ; thy friend, at the ſtream
of Lora? Riſe, in the light of thy ſteel, com-

@13 It appears, from this paſſage, that clanſhip was eſtabliſhed,
in the days of Fingal, though not on the ſame footing with the
preſent tribes in the north of Scotland.
@14 This Connal is very much celebrated in ancient poetry, for
his wiſdom and valour : there is a ſmall tribe ſtill ſubſiſting, in
the North, who pretend they are deſcended from him.
@15 Fingal did not then know that Carthon was the fon of
Cleſs&aacute;mmor.
