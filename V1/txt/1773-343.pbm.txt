100 OINA-MORUL:
--
Con-cathlin @30, on high, from ocean's nightly
wave. My courſe was towards the iſle of
Fu&auml;rfed, woody dweller of ſeas! Fingal had
ſent me to the aid of Mal-orchol, king of
Fu&auml;rfed wild : for war was around him, and
our fathers had met, at the feaſt.

{In} Col-coiled, I bound my ſails; I ſent my
ſword to Mal-orchol of ſhells. He knew the
ſignal of Albion, and his joy aroſe. He came

Oſſian in ſea affairs, a merit, which, perhaps, few of us mo-
derns will allow him, or any in the age in which be lived.
One thing is certain, that the Caledonians often made their
way thro' the dangerous and tempeſtuous ſeas of Scandinavia;
which is more, perhaps, than the more poliſhed nations,
ſubſiſting in thoſe times, dared to venture. In eſtimating
the degree of knowledge of arts among the antients, we
ought not to bring it into compariſon with the improvements
of modern times. Our advantages over them proceed more
from accident, than any merit of ours.
