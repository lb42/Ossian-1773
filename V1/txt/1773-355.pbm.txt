164 OINA-MORUL,
--
it comes not to other ears: it bids Oſſian hear
the hapleſs, in their hour of woe. Retire, ſoft
ſinger by night; Ton-thormod ſhall not mourn
on his rock !”

{With} morning I looſed the king. I gave
the long-haired maid. Mal-orchol heard my
words, in the midſt of his echoing halls. ``King
of Fu&auml;rfed wild, why ſhould Ton-thormod
mourn? He is of the race of heroes, and a
flame in war. Your fathers have been foes, but
now their dim ghoſts rejoice in death. They
ſtretch their hands of miſt to the ſame ſhell in
Loda. Forget their rage, ye warriors, it was
the cloud of other years.”

{Such} were the deeds of Oſſian, while yet his
locks were young : tho' lovelineſs, with a robe
of beams, clothed the daughter of many iſles.
We call back, maid of Lutha, the years that
have rolled away !
