_ARGUMENT._
{Fingal} diſpatches Oſſian and Toſcar, the ſon of Conloch and
father of Malvina, to raiſe a ſtone, on the banks of the
ſtream of Crona, to perpetuate the memory of a victory, which
he had obtained in that place, When they were employed
in that work, Car-ul, a neighbouring chief, invited them
to a feaſt, They went : and Toſcar fell deſperately in love
with Colna-dona, the daughter of Car-ul. Colna-dona be-
came no leſs enamoured of Toſcar. An incident, at a hunt-
ing party, brings their loves to a happy iſſue.
