{Car-ul} kindled the oak of feaſts. He took
two boſſes from our ſhields. He laid them in
earth, beneath a ſtone, to ſpeak to the hero's
race. `` When battle,” ſaid the King, `` ſhall
roar, and our ſons are to meet in wrath. My
race ſhall look, perhaps, on this ſtone, when
they prepare the ſpear. Have not our fathers met
in peace, they will ſay, and lay aſide the ſhield ?”

{Night} came down. In her long locks
moved the daughter of Car-ul. Mixed with the
harp aroſe the voice of white-armed Colna-dona.
Toſcar darkened in his place, before the love of
heroes. She came on his troubled ſoul, like a
beam to the dark-heaving ocean : when it burſts
from a cloud, and brightens the foamy ſide of a
wave @4

{With} morning we awaked the woods ; and
hung forward on the path of the roes. They fell
by their wonted ſtreams. We returned thro'
Crona's vale. From the wood a youth came
forward, with a ſhield and pointleſs ſpear.
`` Whence, ſaid Toſcar of Lutha, is the flying
beam ? Dwells there peace at Col-amon, round
bright Colna-dona of harps ?
