12 COLNA-DONA
--
`` {By} Col-amon of ſtreams,” ſaid the youth,
`` bright Colna-dona dwelt. She dwelt ; but
her courſe is now in deſarts, with the ſon of the
king ; he that ſeized with love her ſoul as it
wandered thro' the hall.” ``Stranger of tales,”
ſaid Toſcar, ``haſt thou marked the warrior's
courſe? He muſt fall, give thou that boſſy
ſhield !” In wrath he took the ſhield. Fair be-
hind it roſe the breaſts of a maid, white as the
boſom of a ſwan, riſing graceful on ſwift-
rolling waves. It was Colna-dona of harps, the
daughter of the king ! Her blue eyes had rolled
on Toſcar, and her love aroſe !
