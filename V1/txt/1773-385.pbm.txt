_ARGUMENT._
Gaul, the ſon of Morni, attended Lathmon into his own coun-
try, after his being defeated in Morven, as related in the
preceding poem. He was kindly entertained by Nu&auml;th, the
father of Lathmon, and fell in love with his daughter
Oithona. The lady was no leſs enamoured of Gaul, and a
day was fixed for their marriage. In the mean time Fingal,
preparing for an expedition into the country of the Britons,
ſent for Gau!. He obeyed, and went; but not without
promiſing to Oithona to return, if he ſurvived the war, by
a certain day. Lathmon too was obliged to attend his father
Nu&auml;th in his wars, and Oithona was left alone at Dunlath-
mon, the ſeat of the family. Dunrommath, lord of Uthal,
ſuppoſed to be one of the Orkneys, taking advantage of the
abſence of her friends, came and carried off, by force,
Oithona, who had formerly rejeCted his love, into Tromi-
thon, a deſart iſland, where he concealed her in a cave.

Gaul returned on the day appointed; heard of the rape,
and ſailed to Tromathon, to revenge himſelf on Dunrom-
math. When he landed, he ſound Oithona diſconſolate,
and reſolved not to ſurvive the loſs of her honour. She told
him the ſtory of her misfortunes, and ſhe ſcarce ended,
when Dunrommath, with his followers, appeared at the
further end of the iſland. Gaul prepared to attack him,
recommending to Oithona to retire, till the battle was over.
She ſeemingly obeyed ; but ſhe ſecretly armed herſelf, ruſhed
into the thickeſt of the battle, and was mortally wounded.
Gaul purſuing the flying enemy, ſound her juſt expiring on
the field; he mourned over her, raiſed her tomb, and
returned to Morven. Thus is the ſtory handed down by
tradition ; nor is it given with any material difference in the
Poem, which opens with Gaul's return to Dunlathmon, after
the rape of Oithona.
