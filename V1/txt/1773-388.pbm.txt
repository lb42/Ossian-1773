_OITH&Oacute;NA:
A
POEM._

{Darkness} dwells around Dunlathmon,
though the moon ſhews half her face on
the hill. The daughter of night turns her eyes
away ; ſhe beholds the approaching grief. The
ſon of Morni is on the plain : there is no ſound
in the hall. No long-ſtreaming beam of light
comes trembling through the gloom. The voice
of Oithona @1 is not heard amidſt the noiſe of the
ſtreams of Duvranna. `` Whither art thou gone
in thy beauty, dark-haired daughter of Nu&auml;th ?
Lathmon is in the field of the valiant, but thou
didſt promiſe to remain in the hall; thou didſt
promiſe to remain in the hall till the ſon of
Morni returned. Till he returned from Stru-
mon, to the maid of his love ! The tear was on
thy cheek at his departure ; the ſigh roſe in ſe-
cret in thy breaſt. But thou doſt not come forth
