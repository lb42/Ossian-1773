_ARGUMENT._
Malvina the daughter of Toſcar is overheard by Oſſian la-
menting the death of Oſcar her lover. Oſſian, to divert her
grief, relates his own actions in an expedition which he
undertook, at Fingal's command, to aid Crothar the petty
king of Croma, a country in Ireland, againſt Rothmar who
invaded his dominions. The ſtory is delivered down thus
in tradition. Crothar king of Croma being blind with age,
and his fon too young for the field, Rothmar the chief of
Tromlo reſolved to avail himſelf of the opportunity offered
of annexing the dominions of Crothar to his own. He ac-
cordingly marched into the country ſubject to Crothar, but
which he held of Arth or Artho, who was, at the time, ſu-
preme king of Ireland.

Crothar being, on account of his age and blindneſs, unfit for
action, ſent for aid to Fingal king of Scotland; who ordered
his ſon Oſſian to the relief of Crothar. But before his
arrival Fovargormo, the ſon of Crothar, attacking Roth-
mar, was ſlain himſelf, and his forces totally defeated.
Oſſian renewed the war; came to battle, killed Rothmar,
and routed his army, Croma being thus delivered of its
enemies, Oſſian returned to Scotland.
