128 CR O M A:
--
preſence, Oſcar, with all my branches round
me; but thy death came like a blaſt from the
deſart, and laid my green head low. The ſpring
returned with its ſhowers; no leaf of mine aroſe !
The virgins ſaw me ſilent in the hall; they
touched the harp of joy. The tear was on the
cheek of Malvina : the virgins beheld me in my
grief. Why art thou ſad, they ſaid ; thou firſt
of the maids of Lutha? Was he lovely as the
beam of the morning, and ſtately in thy ſight?”

{Pleasant} is thy ſong in Oſſian's ear, daugh-
ter of ſtreamy Lutha! Thou haſt heard the
muſic of departed bards, in the dream of thy
reſt, when ſleep fell on thine eyes, at the mur-
mur of Moruth @1. When thou didſt return
from the chace, in the day of the ſun, thou
haſt heard the muſic of bards, and thy ſong is
lovely ! It is lovely, O Malvina, but it melts
the ſoul. There is a joy in grief when peace
dwells in the breaſt of the ſad. But ſorrow
waſtes the mournful, O daughter of Toſcar,
and their days are few! They fall away, like
the flower on which the ſun hath looked in his
ſtrength after the mildew has paſſed over it,
when its head is heavy with the drops of night.
Attend to the tale of Oſſian, O maid. He re-
members the days of his youth !
