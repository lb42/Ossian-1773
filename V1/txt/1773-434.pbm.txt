and the pride of his ſoul aroſe! He came to-
wards Croma ; my people fell before him. I
took my arms in my wrath, but what could
ſightleſs Crothar do? My ſteps were unequal;
my grief was great. I wiſhed for the days that
were paſt. Days! wherein I fought; and won
in the field of blood. My ſon returned from
the chace ; the fair-haired Fovar-gormo @3. He
had not lifted his ſword in battle, for his arm
was young. But the ſoul of the youth was
great ; the fire of valour burnt in his eyes. He
ſaw the diſordered ſteps of his father, and his
ſigh aroſe. `` King of Croma,” he ſaid, `` is it
becauſe thou haſt no ſon; is it for the weak-
neſs of Forar-gormo's arm that thy ſighs
ariſe ? I begin, my father, to feel my ſtrength ;
I have drawn the ſword of my youth;
and I have bent the bow. Let me meet this
Rothmar, with the ſons of Croma : let me meet
him, O my father; I feel my burning ſoul!"
And thou ſhalt meet him, I ſaid, ſon of the
ſightleſs Crothar ! But let others advance before
thee, that I may hear the tread of thy feet at
thy return; for my eyes behold thee not, fair-
haired Fovar-gormo ! He went, he met the
foe; he fell. Rothmar advances to Crema.
He who flew my ſon is near, with all his
pointed ſpears.”
