%{First Bard.}
{Night} is dull and dark. The clouds reſt on the hills.
No ſtar with green trembling beam; no moon looks
from the ſky. I hear the blaſt in the wood ; but I hear it diſ-
tant far. The ſtream of the valley murmurs; but its murmur
is ſullen and ſad. From the tree at the grave of the dead the
long-howling owl is heard. I ſee a dim form on the plain! It
is a ghoſt ! it fades, it flies. Some funeral ſhall paſs this way :
the meteor marks the path.

The diſtant dog is howling from the hut of the hill, The
ſtag lies on the mountain moſs :the hind is at his hide, She
hears the wind in his branchy horns. She ſtarts, but lies again,

The roe is in the cleft of the rock ; the heath-cock's head
is beneath his wing. No beaſt, no bird is abroad, but the
owl and the howling fox. She on a leafleſs tree: he in a
cloud on the hill,

Dark, panting, trembling, ſad the traveller has loſt his way,
Through ſhrubs, through thorns, he goes, along the gurgling
rill. He fears the rock and the fen. He fears the ghoſt of
night. The old tree groans to the blaſt; the falling branch
reſounds. The wind drives the withered burs, clung toge-
ther, along the graſs. It is the light tread of a ghoſt! He
trembles amidſt the night.

Dark, duſky, howling is night, cloudy, windy, and full
of ghoſts! The dead are abroad! my friends, receive me from
the night.

%{Second Bard,}
The wind is up. The ſhower deſcends. The ſpirit of the
mountain ſhrieks. Woods fall from high. Windows flap.
The growing river roars. The traveller attempts the ford.
