{I raised} my voice for Fovar-gormo, when
they laid the chief in earth. The aged Crothar
was there, but his ſigh was not heard. He

yet it was light, on the lake. Is this his broken boat on the
ſhore ? Are theſe his groans on the wind?

Hark! the hail rattles around. The flaky ſnow deſcends,
The tops of the hills are white. The ſtormy winds abate. Va-
rious is the night and cold; receive me, my friends, from
night.
%{Fourth Bard.}
Night is calm and fair; blue, ſtarry, ſettled is night. The
winds, with the clouds, are gone. They ſink behind the hill.
The moon is up on the mountain. Trees gliſter : ſtreams ſhine

of the vale.

I ſee the trees overturned ; the ſhocks of corn on the plain.
The wakeful hind rebuilds the ſhocks, and whiſtles on the diſ-
tant field.

Calm, ſettled, fair is night! Who comes from the place of
the dead ? That form with the robe of ſnow ; white arms and
dark-brown hair! It is the daughter of the chief of the people :

that haſt been the delight of heroes! The blaſt drives the
phantom away; white, without form, it aſcends the hill.

The breezes drive the blue miſt, ſlowly over the narrow
vale. It riſes on the hill, and joins its head to heaven. Night
is ſettled, calm, blue, ſtarry, bright with the moon. Receive

weſt. Slow moves that pale beam along the ſhaded hill, The
giant wave is heard. The torrent murmurs on the rock.
The cock is heard from the booth. More than half the night
