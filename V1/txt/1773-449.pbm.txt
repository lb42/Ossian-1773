136 CR oO M A:
--
ſearched for the wound of his ſon, and ſound it
in his breaſt. Joy roſe in the face of the aged.

is paſt, The houſe-wife, groping in the gloom, rekindles the
ſettled fire. The hunter thinks that day approaches, and calls
his bounding dogs. He aſcends the hill and whiſtles on his way.
A blaſt removes the cloud. He ſees the ſtarry plough of the
north Much of the night is to paſs. He nods by the moſſy
rock.

Hark! the whirlwind is in the wood ! A low murmur in the
vale! it is the mighty army of the dead returning from the air.

The moon reſts behind the hill. The beam is ſtill on that
lofty rock. Long are the ſhadows of the trees. Now it is
dark over all. Night is dreary, ſilent, and dark; receive me,
my friends, from night.

%{The Chief.}
Let clouds reſt on the hills: ſpirits fly and travellers fear.
Let the winds of the woods ariſe, the ſounding ſtorms deſcend.
Roar ſtreams and windows flap, and green winged meteors fly ;
riſe the pale moon from behind her hills, or incloſe her head
in clouds; night is alike to me, blue, ſtormy, or gloomy the
ſky. Night flies before the beam, when it is poured on the
hill. The young day returns from his clouds, but we return
no more.

Where are our chiefs of old? Where our kings of mighty
name? The ſhields of their battles are ſilent. Scarce their moſſy
tombs remain. We ſhall alſo be forgot. This lofty houſe
ſhall fall. Our ſons ſhall not behold the ruins in graſs. They
ſhall aſk of the aged, `` Where ſtood the walls of our fathers ?”

Raiſe the ſong, and ſtrike the harp ; ſend round the ſhells
of joy, Suſpend a hundred tapers on high. Youths and maids
begin the dance. Let ſome gray bard be near me to tell the
deeds of other times ; of kings renowned in our land, of chiefs
we behold no more. Thus let the night paſs until morning
ſhall appear in our halls. Then let the bow be at hand, the
dogs, the youths of the chace. We ſhall aſcend the hill with
day ; and awake the deer.
