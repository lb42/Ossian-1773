He came and ſpoke to Oſſian, `` King of
ſpears !” he ſaid, `` my ſon has not fallen with-
out his fame. The young warrior did not fly;
but met death, as he went forward in his ſtrength.
Happy are they who die in youth, when their
renown is heard! The feeble will not behold
them in the hall; or ſmile at their trembling
hands. Their memory ſhall be honoured in
ſong ; the young tear of the virgin will fall.
But the aged wither away, by degrees, the fame
of their youth, while yet they live is all forgot.
They fall in ſecret. The ſigh of their ſon is not
heard. Joy is around their tomb; the ſtone of
their fame is placed without a tear. Happy are
they who die in youth, when their renown is
around them.
