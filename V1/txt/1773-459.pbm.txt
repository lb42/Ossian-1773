_ARGUMENT._

This piece, as many more of Oſſian's compoſitions, is addreſſed
to one of the firſt Chriſtian miſſionaries. The ſtory of the
poem is handed down, by tradition, thus. In the country
of the Britons between the walls, two chiefs lived in the
days of Fingal, Dunthalmo, lord of Teutha, ſuppoſed to
be the Tweed ; and Rathmor, who dwelt at Clutha, well
known to be the river Clyde. Rathmore was not more re-
nowned for his generoſity and hoſpitality, than Dunthal-
mo was infamous for his cruelty and ambition, Dunthalmo,
through envy, or on account of ſome private feuds, which
ſubſiſted between the families, murdered Cathmore at a
feaſt ; but being afterwards touched with remorſe, he edu-
cated the two ſons of Rathmore, Calthon and Colmar, in
his own houſe. They growing up to man's eſtate, dropped
ſome hints that they intended to revenge the death of their
father, upon which Dunthilmo ſhut them up in two caves
on the banks of Teutha, intending to take them off pri-
vately. Colmal, the daughter of Dunthalmo, who was
ſecretly in love with Calthon, helped him to make his eſcape
from priſon, and fled with him to Fingal, diſguiſed in the
habit of a young warrior, and implored his aid againſt Dun-
thalmo. Fingal ſent Oſſian with three hundred men, to
Colmar's relief. Dunthalmo having previouſly murdered
Colmar, came to a battle with Oſſan; but he was killed by
that hero, and his army totally defeated,

Calthon married Colmal, his deliverer; and Oſſian re-
turned to Morven.
