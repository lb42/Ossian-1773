146 CALTHON and COLMAL:
--
come to my halls, my eyes behold them not.
But my arm is ſtretched forth to the unhappy.
My ſword defends the weak.”

{I rejoiced} in the words of the king. I took
my rattling arms. Diaran @5 roſe at my ſide, and
Dargo @6 king of ſpears. Three hundred youths
--
followed
==
@5 Diaran, father of that Connal who was unfortunately killed
by Crimora, his miſtreſs.
@6 Dargo, the ſon of Collath, is celebrated in other poems
by Oſſian. He is ſaid to have been killed by a boar at a hunt-
ing party. The lamentation of his miſtreſs, or wife, Min-
gala, over his body, is extant ; but whether it is of Oſſian's
compoſition, I cannot determine. It is generally aſcribed to
him, and has much of his manner ; but ſome traditions men-
tion it as an imitation by ſome later bard. As it has ſome
poetical merit, I have ſubjoined it.

{The} ſpouſe of Dargo comes in tears: for Dargo was no
 more! The heroes ſigh over Lartho's chief: and what
ſhall ſad Mingala do? The dark ſoul vaniſhed like morning
miſt, before the king of ſpears: but the generous glowed in
his preſence like the morning ſtar.

Who was the faireſt and moſt lovely ? Who but Collath's
ſtately fon? Who ſat in the midſt of the wiſe, but Dargo of
the mighty deeds ?

Thy hand touched the trembling harp: Thy voice was
ſoft as ſummer-winds. Ah me! what ſhall the Heroes ſay ?
for Dargo fell before a boar. Pale is the lovely cheek; the
look of which was firm in danger ! Why haſt thou failed on
our hills, thou fairer than the beams of the ſun ?

The daughter of Adonſion was lovely in the eyes of the vali-
ant ; ſhe was lovely in their eyes, but ſhe choſe to be the ſpouſe
of Dargo. 

But thou art alone, Mingala! the night is coming with
its clouds; where is the bed of thy repoſe ? Where but in the
tomb of Dargo ?
