followed our ſteps : the lovely ſtrangers were at
my ſide. Dunthalmo heard the ſound of our
approach. He gathered the ſtrength of Teutha.
He ſtood on a hill with his hoſt. They were
like rocks broken with thunder, when their bent
trees are ſinged and bare, and the ſtreams of their
chinks have failed. The ſtream of Teutha rolled,
in its pride, before the gloomy foe. I ſent a
bard to Dunthalmo, to offer the combat on the
plain ; but he ſmiled in the darkneſs of his pride.
His unſettled hoſt moved on the hill ; like the
mountain-cloud, when the blaſt has entered its
womb, and ſcatters the curling gloom on every
ſide.

They brought Colmar to Teutha's bank,
bound with a thouſand thongs. The chief is
ſad, but ſtately. His eye is on his friends ; for
we ſtood, in our arms, whilſt Teutha's waters
rolled between. Dunthalmo came with his ſpear,
and pierced the hero's ſide : he rolled on the
bank in his blood. We heard his broken ſighs.
Calthon ruſhed into the ſtream : I bounded for-
ward on my ſpear. Teutha's race fell before us.

Why doſt thou lift the ſtone, O bard! why doſt thou ſhut
the narrow houſe? Mingala's eyes are heavy, bard ! She muſt
ſleep with Dargo.

Laſt night I heard the ſong of joy in Lartho's lofty hall. But
ſilence dwells around my bed. Mingala reſts with Dargo.
