_ARGUMENT._
Caros is probably the noted uſurper Carauſius, by birth a
Menapian, who aſſumed the purple in the year 284: and,
ſeizing on Britain, defeated the Emperor Maximian Her-
culius in ſeveral naval engagements, which gives propriety
to his being called in this poem {{the king of ſhips}}. He re-
paired Agricola's wall, in order to obſtruct the incurſions
of the Caledonians; and when he was employed in that
work, it appears he was attacked by a party under the
command of Oſcar the ſon of Oſſian. This battle is the
ſoundation of the preſent poem, which is addreſſed to Mal-
vina the daughter of Toſcar.
