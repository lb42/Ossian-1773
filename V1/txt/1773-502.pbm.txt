_THE
WAR of CAROS:
A
POEM._
{Bring}, daughter of Toſcar, bring the
 harp ! the light of the ſong riſes in Oſſian's
ſoul ! It is like the field, when darkneſs covers
the hills around, and the ſhadow grows ſlowly
on the plain of the ſun. I behold my ſon, O
Malvina, near the moſſy rock of Crona @1. But
it is the miſt of the deſart, tinged with the beam
of the weſt ! Lovely is the miſt, that aſſumes the
form of Oſcar! turn from it, ye winds, when
ye roar on the ſide of Ardven !

{Who} comes towards my ſon, with the mur-
mur of a ſong? His ſtaff is in his hand, his
grey hair looſe on the wind. Surly joy

@1 Crona is the name of a ſmall ſtream which runs into the
