158 The WAR of CAROS:
--
The ſongs of Oſſian have been heard ; thy ghoſt
has brightened in wind, when thou didſt bend
from thy cloud, to hear the ſong of Morven's

renowned in the days of my fathers? His name
remains on the rocks of Cona. I hare often

Comala, and his eyes could not behold the
chief. Lonely, ſad along the heath he, ſlowly,
moved, with ſilent ſteps. His arms hang diſ-
ordered on his ſide. His hair flies looſe from
his brow. The tear is in his down-caſt eyes; a
ſigh half-ſilent in his breaſt! Three days he
ſtrayed unſeen, alone, before he came to La-
mor's halls : the moſſy halls of his fathers, at
the ſtream of Balva @7. There Lamor ſat alone
beneath a tree; for he had ſent his people with
Hidallan to war. The ſtream ran at his feet,
his grey head reſted on his ſtaff. Sightleſs are
his aged eyes. He hums the ſong of other times.

Glentivar, {{the ſequeſtered vale}}.
