160 The WAR of CAROS:
--
Comala ; he denied his wars to Hidallan. Go to
the grey ſtreams of thy land, he ſaid ; moulder
like a leafleſs oak, which the winds have bent
over Balva, never more to grow!”
`` {And} muſt I hear,” Lamor replied, `` the
lonely tread of Hidallan's feet? When thouſands
are renowned in battle, ſhall he bend over my
grey ſtreams? Spirit of the noble Garm&aacute;llon !
carry Lamor to his place; his eyes are dark;
his ſoul is ſad ; his ſon has loft his fame !”

`` {Where},” ſaid the youth, `` ſhall I ſearch
for fame to gladden the ſoul of Lamor? From
whence ſhall I return with renown, that the
ſound of my arms may be pleaſant in his ear ?
If I go to the chace of hinds, my name will not
be heard. Lamor will not feel my dogs, with
his hands, glad at my arrival from the hill. He
will not enquire of his mountains, or of the
dark-brown deer of his deſarts !”

`` {I must} fall,” ſaid Lamor, `` like a leafleſs
oak: it grew on a rock! it was overturned by
the winds! My ghoſt will be ſeen on my hills,
mournful for my young Hidallan. Will not
ye, ye miſts, as ye riſe, hide him from my
ſight? My ſon! go to Lamor's hall : there the
arms of our fathers hang. Bring the ſword of
Garmallon ; he took it from a foe!"
