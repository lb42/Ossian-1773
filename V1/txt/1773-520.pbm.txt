He went and brought the ſword with all its
ſtudded thongs. He gave it to his father. The
grey-haired hero felt the point with his hand.

`` {My} ſon! lead me to Garm&aacute;llon's tomb :
it riſes beſide that ruſtling tree. The long graſs
is withered; I hear the breezes whiſtling there.
A little fountain murmurs near, and ſends its
water to Balva. There let me reſt; it is noon ;
the ſun is on our fields !”

{He} led him to Garmillon's tomb. Lamor
pierced the ſide of his ſon. They ſleep toge-
ther : their ancient halls moulder away. Ghoſts
are ſeen there at noon : the valley is ſilent, and
the people ſhun the place of Lamor.

``{Mournful} is thy tale,” ſaid Oſcar, `` ſon
of the times of old ! My ſoul ſighs for Hidallan;
he fell in the days of his youth. He flies on the
blaſt of the deſart, his wandering is in a foreign
land. Sons of the ecchoing Morven! draw
near to the foes of Fingal. Send the night
away in ſongs; watch the ſtrength of Caros.
Oſcar goes to the people of other times ; to the
ſhades of ſilent Ardven; where his fathers ſit
dim in their clouds, and behold the future war.
And art thou there, Hidallan, like a half-extin-
guiſhed meteor ? Come to my ſight, in thy ſor-
row, chief of the winding Balva!”
