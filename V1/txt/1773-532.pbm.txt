goeſt to the fields of thy fame, where Caros
fled from thy lifted ſword.

{Darkness} comes on my ſoul, O fair daugh-
ter of Toſcar, I behold not the form of my ſon
at Carun; nor the figure of Oſcar on Crona.
The ruſtling winds have carried him far away ;
an the heart of his father is ſad. But lead me,
O Malvina, to the ſound of my woods; to the
roar of my mountain ſtreams. Let the chace
be heard on Cona ; let me think on the days of
other years. And bring me the harp, O maid,
that I may touch it, when the light of my ſoul
ſhall ariſe, Be thou near, to learn the ſong ;
future times ſhall hear of me! The ſons of the
feeble hereafter will lift the voice on Cona ; and,
looking up to the rocks, ſay, ``Here Oſſian
dwelt.” They ſhall admire the chiefs of old,
the race that are no more! while we ride on our
clouds, Malvina, on the wings of the roaring
winds. Our voices ſhall be heard, at times, in
the deſart; we ſhall ſing on the breeze of the
rock.
