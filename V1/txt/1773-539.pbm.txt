relates the arrival of Cathlin in Selma, to ſolicit aid againſt
Duth-carmor of Cluba, who had killed Cathmol, for the
ſake of his daughter Lan&ubreve;l. Fingal declining to make a
choice among his heroes, who were all claiming the com-
mand of the expedition ; they retired {{each to his hill of
ghoſts}} ; to be determined by dreams. The ſpirit of Trenmor
appears to Oſſian and Oſcar : they ſail, from the bay of Car-
mona, and, on the fourth day, appear off the valley of Rath- 
col, in Inis-huna, where Duth-carmor had fixed his reſi-
dence. Oſſian diſpatches a bard to Duth-carmor to demand
battle. Night comes on. The diſtreſs of Cathlin of Clutha.
Oſſian devolves the command on Oſcar, who, according to
the cuſtom of the kings of Morven, before battle, retired to
a neighbouring hill. Upon the coming on of day, the battle
joins. Oſcar and Duth-carmor meet. The latter falls.
Oſcar carries the mail and helmet of Duth-carmor to Cath-
lin, who had retired from the field. Cathlin is diſcovered
to be the daughter of Cathmol, in diſguiſe, who had been
carried off, by force, by, and had made her eſcape from,
Duth-carmor.
