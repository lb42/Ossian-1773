_CATHLIN of CLUTHA:
A
POEM._
@1{Come}, thou beam that art lonely, from
watching in the night! The ſqually winds
are around thee, from all their echoing hills.
Red, over my hundred ſtreams, are the light-

@1 The traditions, which accompany this poem, inform us,
that it went, of old, under the name of {{Laoi-Oi-lutha}}; i. e,
the {{hymn of the maid of Lutha}}. They pretend alſo to fix the
time of its compoſition, to the third year after the death
of Fingal ; that is, during the expedition of Fergus the
ſon of Fingal, to the banks of {{Uiſca-duthon}}. In ſupport
of this opinion, the Highland ſenachies have prefixed to
his poem, an addreſs of Oſſian, to Congal the young ſon
of Fergus, which I have rejected, as having no manner of
connection with the reſt of the piece. It has poetical merit ;
and, probably, it was the opening of one of Oſſian's other
poems, tho' the bards injudiciouſly transferred it to the piece
now before us.

``Congal, ſon of Fergus of Durath, thou light between thy
locks, aſcend to the rock of Selma, to the oak of the breaker
of ſhields. Look over the boſom of night, it is ſtreaked with
the red paths of the dead: look on the night of ghoſts, and
