tance ſtood Cathlin of Clutha. I ſaw the change-
ful @7 ſoul of the ſtranger. As ſhadows fly over
the field of graſs, ſo various is Cathlin's cheek.
It was fair, within locks, that roſe on Rath-col's
wind. I did not ruſh, amidſt his ſoul, with my
words. I bade the ſong to riſe.

@7 From this circumſtance, ſucceeding bards feigned that
Cathlin, who is here in the diſguiſe of a young warrior, had
fallen in love with Duth-carmor at a feaſt, to which he had
been invited by her father. Her love was converted into de-
teſtation for him, after he had murdered her father. But {{as
thoſe rain-bows of heaven are changeful}}, ſay my authors, ſpeak-
ing of women, ſhe felt the return of her former paſſion, upon
the approach of Duth-carmor's danger. I myſelf, who think
more favourably of the ſex, muſt attribute the agitation of
Cathlin's mind to her extream ſenſibility to the injuries done
her by Duth-carmor; and this opinion is favoured by the
ſequel of the ſtory.
@8 This paſſage alludes to the well known cuſtom among the
ancient kings of Scotland, to retire from their army on the
night preceding a battle. The ſtory which Oſſian intro-
duces in the next paragraph, concerns the fall of the
Druids. It is ſaid in many old poems, that the Druids,
in the extremity of their affairs, had ſolicited and ob-
tained aid from Scandinavia. Among the auxiliaries there
came many pretended magicians, which circumſtance Oſſian
alludes to, in his deſcription of the {{ſon of Loda}}, Magic and
incantation could not, however, prevail ; for Trenmor, aſſiſted
by the valour of his ſon Trathal, entirely broke the power of
the Druids.
