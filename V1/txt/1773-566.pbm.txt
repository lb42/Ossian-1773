ſkirt was Trathal, like a riſing light. It was
dark; and Loda's ſon poured forth his ſigns, on
night. The feeble were not before thee, ſon of
other lands!@9 Then roſe the ſtrife of kings,
about the hill of night; but it was ſoft as two
ſummer gales, ſhaking their light wings, on a
lake. Trenmor yielded to his ſon ; for the fame
of the king had been heard. Trathal came forth
before his father, and the foes failed, in echo-
ing Caracha. The years that are paſt, my ſon,
are marked with mighty deeds @10.”

{In} clouds roſe the eaſtern light. The foe
came forth in arms. The ſtrife is mixed on
Rath-col, like the roar of ſtreams. Behold the
contending of kings ! They meet beſide the oak.
In gleams of ſteel the dark forms are loſt ; ſuch
is the meeting of meteors, in a vale by night :
red light is ſcattered round, and men foreſee the
ſtorm ! Duth-carmor is low in blood!h The ſon
of Oſſian overcame ! Not harmleſs in battle was
he, Malvina hand of harps !

@9 Trenmor and Trathal, Oſſian introduced this epiſode, as
an example to his ſon, from ancient times.
@10 Thoſe who deliver down this poem in tradition, lament
that there is a great part of it loſt. In particular they regret
the loſs of an epiſode, which was here introduced, with the
ſequel of the ſtory of Carmal and his Druids. Their attach-
ment to it was ſounded on the deſcriptions of magical inchant-
ments which it contained.
