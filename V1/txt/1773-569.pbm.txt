©98 CATHLIN or CLUTHA:
--

{Nor}, in the field, were the ſteps of Cath-
lin. The ſtranger ſtood by a ſecret ſtream,
where the foam of Rath-col ſkirted the moſſy
ſtones. Above, bends the branchy birch, and
ſtrews its leaves, on wind. The inverted ſpear
of Cathlin touched, at times, the ſtream. Oſcar
brought Duth-carmor's mail : his helmet with
its eagle-wing. He placed them before the
ſtranger, and his words were heard. `` The
foes of thy father have failed. They are laid
in the field of ghoſts. Renown returns to Mor-
ven, like a riſing wind. Why art thou dark,
chief of Clutha ? Is there cauſe for grief?

`` {Son} of Oſſian of harps, my ſoul is darkly ſad.
I behold the arms of Cathmol, which he raiſed
in war. Take the mail of Cathlin, place it
high in Selma's hall; that thou mayſt remember
the hapleſs in thy diſtant land.” From white
breaſts deſcended the mail. It was the race of
kings; the ſoft-handed daughter of Cathmol,
at the ſtreams of Clutha! Duth-carmor ſaw
her bright in the hall, he had come, by night,
to Clutha. Cathmol met him, in battle, but the
hero fell. Three days dwelt the foe, with the
maid. On the fourth ſhe fled in arms. She
remembered the race of kings, and felt her burſt-
ing ſoul!
