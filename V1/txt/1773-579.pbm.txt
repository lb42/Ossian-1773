_ARGUMENT._
{This} poem, which, properly ſpeaking, is a continuation of
the laſt, opens with an addreſs to Sul-malla, the daughter
of the king of Inis-huna, whom Oſſian met, at the chace,
as he returned from the battle ef Rath-col. Sul-malla in-
vites Oſſian and Oſcar to a feaſt, at the reſidence of her
father, who was then abſent in the wars. Upon hearing
their name and family, ſhe relates an expedition of Fingal
into Inis huna. She caſually mentioning Cathmor, chief
of Atha, (who then aſſiſted her father againſt his enemies)
Oſſian introduces the epiſode of Culgorm and Surandronlo,
two Scandinavian kings, in whoſe wars Oſſian himſelf and
Cathmor were engaged on oppoſite ſides. The ſtory is
imperſect, a part of the original being loſt. Oſſian, warned,
in a dream, by the ghoſt of Trenmor, ſets ſail from Inis-
huna.
