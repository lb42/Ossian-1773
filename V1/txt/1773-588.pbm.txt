@2 Sul-malla here diſcovers the quality of Oſſian and Oſcar,
from their ſtature and ſtately gait. Among nations, not far
advanced in civilization, a ſuperior beauty and ſtatelineſs of
perſon were inſeparable from nobility of blood. It was from
theſe qualities, that thoſe of family were known by ſtrangers,
not from tawdry trappings of ſtate injudiciouſly thrown round
them. The cauſe of this diſtinguiſhing property, muſt, in
ſome meaſure, be aſcribed to their unmixed blood. They
had no inducement to intermarry with the vulgar: and no
low notions of intereſt made them deviate from their choice,
in their own ſphere. In ſtates, where luxury has been
long eſtabliſhed, beauty of perſon is, by no means, the
characteriſtic of antiquity of family. This muſt be attri-
buted to thoſe enervating vices, which are inſeparable from
luxury and wealth. A great family, (to alter a little the
words of the hiſtorian) it is true, like a river, becomes conſi-
derable from the length of its courſe, but, as it rolls on,
hereditary diſtempers, as well as property, flow ſucceſively
into it.
