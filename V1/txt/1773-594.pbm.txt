``{Darkness} dwells in Cluba of harps : the
race of kings is diſtant far ; in battle is my father
Conmor: and Lormar @5 my brother, king of
ſtreams. Nor darkening alone are they; a
beam, from other lands, is nigh; the friend of
ſtrangers @6 in Atha, the troubler of the field.
High, from their miſty hills, look forth the blue
eyes of Erin; for he is far away, young dweller
of their ſouls! Nor, harmleſs, white hands of
Erin ! is Cathmor in the ſkirts of war; he
rolls ten thouſand before him, in his diſtant
field.”

``{Not} unſeen by Oſſian,” I ſaid, `` ruſhed
Cathmor from his ſtreams, when he poured his
==
undiſguiſed manners of mankind. War and an active life, as
they call forth, by turns, all the powers of the ſoul, preſent
to us the different characters of men: in times of peace and
quiet, for want of objects to exert them, the powers of the
mind lie concealed, in a great meaſure, and we ſee only arti-
ficial paſſions and manners. It is from this conſideration I
conclude, that a traveller of penetration could gather more
genuine knowlege from a tour of ancient Gaul, than from
the minuteſt obſervation of all the artificial manners, and ele-
gant refinements of modern France.
@5 Lormar was the ſon of Conmor, and the brother of Sul-
malla. After the death of Conmor, Lormar ſucceeded him
in the throne.
@6 Cathmor, the ſon of Barbar-duthul. It would appear,
from the partiality with which Sul-malla ſpeaks of that hero,
that ſhe had ſeen him, previous to his joining her father's
army ; tho' tradition poſitively aſſerts, that it was, after his
return, that ſhe fell in love with him.
