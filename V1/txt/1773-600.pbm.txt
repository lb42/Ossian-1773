Cathmor heard my voice; for he lay, beneath
the oak, in all his gleaming arms. Morning
came; we ruſhed to fight: from wing to wing

thiſtle's head, beneath autumnal winds.

ſtrokes with the chief. By turns our ſhields

helmet fell to the ground. In brightneſs ſhone

between his wandering locks. I knew Cathmor

we turned, and ſilent paſſed to mix with other
foes.”

conjecture muſt ſupply the place of argument and poſitive
proofs.
