Her eyes were wandering flames, amidſt diſor-
dered locks. Forward is her white arm, with
the ſpear ; her high-heaving breaſt is ſeen, white
as foamy waves that rife, by turns, amidſt rocks.
They are beautiful, but terrible, and mariners
call the winds !”

``{Come}, ye dwellers of Loda!” ſhe ſaid,
`` come, Carchar, pale in the midſt of clouds !

thought they ſound in the tales of Oſſian, have given us the
continuation of the ſtory of the daughter of Suran-dronlo.
The cataſtrophe is ſo unnatural, and the circumſtances of it fo
ridiculouſly pompous, that, for the ſake of the inventors, I ſhall
conceal them.

The wildly beautiful appearance of Runo-forlo, made a
deep impreſſion on a chief, ſome ages ago, who was himſelf
no contemptible poet. The ſtory is romantic, but not incre-
dible, if we make allowances for the lively imagination of a
man of genius. Our chief ſailing, in a ſtorm, along one of
the iſlands of Orkney, ſaw a woman, in a boat, near the
ſhore, whom he thought, as he expreſſes it himſelf, {{as beauti-
ful as a ſudden ray of the ſun, on the dark-heaving deep}}. The
verſes of Oſſian, on the attitude of Runo-forlo, which was ſo
ſimilar to that of the woman in the boat, wrought ſo much on
his fancy, that he fell deſperately in love. The winds, how-
ever, drove him from the coaſt, and, aſter a few days, he arrived
at his reſidence in Scotland. There his paſſion increaſed to
ſuch a degree, that two of his friends, fearing the conſequence,
ſailed to the Orkneys, to carry to him the objet of his deſire.
Upon enquiry they ſoon ſound the nymph, and carried her to
the enamoured chief; but mark his ſurprize, when, inſtead
{{of a ray of the fun}}, he ſaw a ſkinny fiſherwoman, more than
middle aged, appearing before him. Tradition here ends the
ſtory : but it may be eaſily ſuppoſed that the paſſion of the
chief ſoon ſubſided.
