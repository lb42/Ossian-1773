192 SUL-MALLA or LUMON:
--
Sluthmor, that ſtrideſt in airy halls ! Corchtur,
terrible in winds ! Receive, from his daughter's
ſpear, the foes of Suran-dronlo. No ſhadow,
at his roaring ſtreams; no mildly-looking form
was he ! When he took up his ſpear, the hawks
ſhook their ſounding wings: for blood was
poured around the fleps of dark-eyed Suran-
dronlo. He lighted me, no harmleſs beam, to
glitter on his ſtreams. Like meteors, I was
bright, but I blaſted the foes of Suran-dronlo.”

{Nor} unconcerned heard Sul-malla, the praiſe
of Cathmor of ſhields. He was within her ſoul,
like a fire in ſecret heath, which awakes at the
voice of the blaſt, and ſends its beam abroad.
Amidſt the ſong removed the daughter of kings,
like the voice of a ſummer-breeze; when it
lifts the heads of flowers, and curls the lakes and
ſtreams. The ruſtling ſound gently ſpreads o'er
the vale, foſtly-pleaſing as it ſaddens the ſoul.

By night came a dream to Oſſian; formleſs
ſtood the ſhadow of Trenmor. He ſeemed to
ſtrike the dim ſhield, on Selma's ſtreamy rock.
I roſe, in my rattling ſteel ; I knew that war was
near, before the winds our ſails were ſpread ;
when Lumon ſhewed its ſtreams to the morn.

{Come} from the watching of night, Malvina,
lonely beam !
