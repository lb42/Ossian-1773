196 The WAR of INIS-THONA:
--
midſt. He leans on the ſhield of Trenmor: his
ſpear ſtands againſt the wall ; he liſtens to the
ſong of his bards. The deeds of his arm are
heard; the actions of the king in his youth !
Oſcar had returned from the chace, and heard
the hero's praiſe. He took the ſhield of Branno @1 
from the wall; his eyes were filled with tears.
Red was the cheek of youth. His voice was
trembling, low. My ſpear ſhook its bright
head in his hand : he ſpoke to Morven's king.

``{Fingal}! thou king of heroes! Oſſian,
next to him in war! ye have fought in your
youth; your names are renowned in ſong.
Oſcar is like the miſt of Cona ; I appear and I
vaniſh away. The bard will not know my name.
The hunter will not ſearch in the heath for my
tomb. Let me fight, O heroes, in the battles
of Inis-Thona. Diſtant is the land of my war!
ye ſhall not hear of Oſcar's fall ! Some bard may
find me there ; ſome bard may give my name to
ſong. The daughter of the ſtranger ſhall ſee
my tomb, and weep over the youth, that came
from afar. The bard ſhall ſay, at the feaſt,
`` hear the ſong of Oſcar from the diſtant land !”

@1 This is Branno, the father of Everallin, and grandfather
to Oſcar; he was of Iriſh extraction, and lord of the country
round the lake of Lego. His great actions are handed down
by tradition, and his hoſpitality has paſſed into a proverb.
