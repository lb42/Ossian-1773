193 The WAR of INIS-THONA:
--
art of Morven's race! Annir has ſeen the battle
of ſpears ; but now he is pale and withered, like
the oak of Lano. I have no ſon to meet thee
with joy, to bring thee to the halls of his fa-
thers. Argon is pale in the tomb, and Ruro is
no more. My daughter is in the hall of ſtran-
gers : ſhe longs to behold my tomb. Her ſpouſe
ſhakes ten thouſand ſpears; he comes @3 a cloud
of death from Lano. Come, to ſhare the feaſt
of Annir, ſon of ecchoing Morven !”

{Three} days they feaſted together; on the
fourth, Annir heard the name of Oſcar. They
rejoiced in the ſhell @4. They purſued the boars
of Runa. Beſide the fount of moſſy ſtones, the
weary heroes reſt. The tear ſteals in ſecret from
Annir: he broke the riſing ſigh. `` Here darkly
reſt,” the hero ſaid, `` the children of my youth.
This ſtone is the tomb of Ruro; that tree ſounds

@3 Cormalo had reſolved on a war againſt his father in law
Annir king of Inis-thona, in order to deprive him of his king-
dom : the injuſtice of his deſigns was ſo much reſented by Fin-
gal, that he ſent his grandſon, Oſcar, to the aſſiſtance of Annir.
Both armies came ſoon to a battle, in which the conduct and
valour of Oſcar obtained a compleat victory. An end was put
to the war by the death of Cormalo, who fell in a ſingle com-
bat, by Oſcar's hand. Thus is the ſtory delivered down by
tradition ; though the poet, to raiſe the character of his ſon,
makes Oſcar himſelf propoſe the expedition.
@4 {{To rejoice in the ſhell}} is a phraſe for feaſting ſumptuouſly
and drinking freely.
