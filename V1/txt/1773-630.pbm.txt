over the grave of Argon, Do ye hear my voice,
O my ſons, within your narrow houſe ? Or do
ye ſpeak in theſe ruſtling leaves, when the winds
of the deſart riſe ?”

`` {King} of Inis-thona,” ſaid Oſcar, `` how
fell the children of youth? The wild boar ruſhes
over their tombs, but he does not diſturb their
repoſe, They purſue deer@5  formed of clouds,
and bend their airy bow. They ſtill love the
ſport of their youth ; and mount the wind with
joy."

``{Cormalo},” replicd the king, `` is a chief of
ten thouſand ſpears. He dwells at the waters of
Lano @6, which ſends forth the vapour of death.
He came to Runa's ecchoing halls, and ſought
the honour of the ſpear @7. The youth was lovely
as the firſt beam of the ſun ; few were they who
could meet him in fight ! My heroes yielded to
Cormalo : my daughter was ſeized in his love.

@5 The notion of Oſſian concerning the ſtate of the deceaſed,
was the ſame with that of the ancient Greeks and Romans.
They imagined that the ſouls purſued, in their ſeparate ſtate,
the employments and pleaſures of their former life.
@6 Lano was a lake of Scandinavia, remarkable, in the days
of Oſſian, for emitting a peſtilential vapour in autumn. {{And
thou, O valiant Duchomar, like the miſt of marſhy Lano ; when
it ſails ever the plains of autumn, and brings death to the hoſt.}}
{Fingal}, B. I.
@7 By {{the honour of the ſpear}} is meant the tournament practiſ-
ed among the ancient northern nations.
