300 The WAR of INIS-THONA:
--

Argon and Ruro returned from the chace; the
tears of their pride deſcend : they roll their
ſilent eyes on Runa's heroes, who had yielded
to a ſtranger. Three days they feaſted with Cor-
malo : on the fourth young Argon fought. But
who could fight with Argon ! Cormalo is over-
come. His heart ſwelled with the grief of
pride; he reſolved, in ſecret, to behold the
death of my ſons? They went to the hills of
Runa : they purſued the dark-brown hinds.
The arrow of Cormalo flew in ſecret ; my chil-
dren fell in blood. He came to the maid of his
love ; to Inis-thona's long-haired maid. They
fled over the deſart. Annir remained alone.
Night came on and day appeared; nor Ar-
gon's voice, nor Ruro's came. At length their
much-loved dog was ſeen ; the fleet and bound-
ing Runar. He came into the hall and howled ;
and ſeemed to look towards the place of their
fall. We followed him : we ſound them here :
we laid them by this moſſy ſtream. This is the
haunt of Annir, when the chace of the hinds is
paſt. I bend like the trunk of an aged oak; my
tears for ever flow !

`` {O Ronnan} !” ſaid the riſing Oſcar, `` Ogar
king of ſpears! call my heroes to my ſide,
the ſons of ſtreamy Morven. To-day we go to
Lano's water, that ſends forth the vapour of
--
death.
