death. Cormalo will not long rejoice: death is
often at the point of our ſwords !”

{They} came over the deſart like ſtormy
clouds, when the winds roll them along the
heath : their edges are tinged with lightning ;
the ecchoing groves foreſee the form! The
horn of Oſcar's battle is heard ; Lano ſhook over
all its waves. The children of the lake convened
around the ſounding ſhield of Cormalo. Oſcar
fought, as he was wont in war. Cormalo fell
beneath his ſword : the ſons of diſmal Lano fled
to their ſecret vales! Oſcar brought the daugh-
ter of Inis-thona to Annir's ecchoing halls. The
face of age is bright with joy ; he bleſt the king
of ſwords !

How great was the joy of Oſſian, when he be-
held the diſtant fail of his ſon! it was like a
cloud of light that riſes in the eaſt, when the
traveller is ſad in a land unknown; and diſmal
night, with her ghoſts, is fitting around in ſhades!
We brought him, with ſongs, to Selma's halls.
Fingal ſpread the feaſt of ſhells. A thouſand
bards raiſed the name of Oſcar : Morven an-
ſwered to the ſound. The daughter of Toſcar
was there; her voice was like the harp; when
the diſtant ſound comes, in the evening, on the
foſt-ruſtling breeze of the vale!
