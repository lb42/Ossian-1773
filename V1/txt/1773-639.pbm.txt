202 The WAR of INIS-THONA.
--

{O Lay} me, ye that ſee the light, near ſome
rock of my hills ! let the thick hazels be around,
let the ruſtling oak be near. Green be the place
of my reſt; let the ſound of the diſtant torrent
be heard. Daughter of Toſcar, take the harp,
and raiſe the lovely ſong of Selma ; that ſleep
may overtake my ſoul in the midſt of joy ; that
the dreams of my youth may return, and the
days of the mighty Fingal. Selma! I behold
thy towers, thy trees, thy ſhaded wall ! I ſee the
heroes of Morven ; I hear the ſong of bards !
Oſcar lifts the ſword of Cormalo; a thouſand
youths admire its ſtudded thongs. They look
with wonder on my ſon: They admire the
ſtrength of his arm. They mark the joy of
his father's eyes; they long for an equal fame.
And ye ſhall have your fame, O ſons of ſtreamy
Morven! My ſoul is often brightened with
ſong; I remember the friends of my youth.
But ſleep deſcends, in the ſound of the harp!
pleaſant dreams begin to riſe! Ye ſons of the
chace ſtand far diſtant, nor diſturb my reſt.
The bard of other times holds diſcourſe with his
fathers, the chief of the days of old ! Sons of
the chace, ſtand far diſtant ! diſturb not the
dreams of Oſſian !
