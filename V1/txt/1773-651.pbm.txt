haired Ullin! ſtately Ryno! Alpin @1, with the
tuneful voice! the ſoft complaint of Minona!
How are ye changed, my friends, ſince the days
of Selma's feaſt ? when we contended, like gales
of ſpring, as they fly along the hill, and bend
by turns the feebly-whiſtling graſs.

{Minona} @2 came forth in her beauty ; with
down-caſt look and tearful eye. Her hair flew
ſlowly on the blaſt, that ruſhed unfrequent from
the hill. The ſouls of the heroes were ſad when
ſhe raiſed the tuneful voice. Often had they
ſeen the grave of Salgar 3, the dark dwelling of
white-boſomed Colma @4. Colma left alone on
the hill, with all her voice of ſong! Salgar
promiſed to come: but the night deſcended
around. Hear the voice of Colma, when ſhe
ſat alone on the hill !

@1 Alpin is from the ſame root with Albion, or rather Al-
bin, the ancient name of Britain; Alp, {{high Iſland}}, or {{coun-
try}}. The preſent name of our iſland has its origin in the
Celtic tongue; ſo that thoſe who derived it from any other,
betrayed their ignorance of the ancient language of our coun-
try. {{Brait}} or {{Braid}}, extenſive; and {{in}}, land.
@2 Oſſian introduces Minona, not in the ideal ſcene in his
own mind, which he had deſcribed ; but at the annual feaſt of
Selma, where the bards repeated their works before Fingal.
@3 Sealg-'er, {{a hunter}}.
@4 Cul math, {{a woman with fine hair.}}
