The SONGS of SELMA. 207

%{Colma.}
{It} is night; I am alone, forlorn on the hill
of ſtorms. The wind is heard in the mountain.
The torrent pours down the rock. No hut re-
ceives me from the rain; forlorn on the hill of
winds !

{Rise}, moon ! from behind thy clouds. Stars
of the night ariſe! Lead me, ſome light, to the
place, where my love reſts from the chace
alone! his bow near him, unſtrung: his dogs
panting around him. But here I muſt ſit alone,
by the rock of the moſſy ſtream. The ſtream
and the wind roar aloud. I hear not the voice
of my love! Why delays my Salgar, why the
chief of the hill, his promiſe ? Here is the rock,
and here the tree! here is the roaring ſtream !
Thou didſt promiſe with night to be here. Ah!
whither is my Salgar gone ? With thee I would
fly, from my father ; with thee, from my bro-
ther of pride. Our race have long been foes ;
we are not foes, O Salgar!

{Cease} a little while, O wind! ſtream, be
thou ſilent a while! let my voice be heard
around. Let my wanderer hear me ! Salgar ! it
is Colma who calls. Here is the tree, and the
rock. Salgar, my love! I am here. Why
delayeſt thou thy coming? Lo! the calm moon
