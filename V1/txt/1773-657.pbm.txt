comes forth. The flood is bright in the vale.
The rocks are grey on the ſteep. I ſee him not
on the brow. His dogs come not before him,
with tidings of his near approach. Here I muſt
ſit alone !

{Who} lie on the heath beſide me? Are they
my love and my brother ? Speak to me, O my
friends! To Colma they give no reply. Speak
to me: I am alone! My ſoul is tormented with
fears! Ah! they are dead ! Their ſwords are red
from the fight. O my brother ! my brother !
why haſt thou ſlain my Salgar? why, O Sal-
gar! haſt thou ſlain my brother ? Dear were ye
both to me ! what ſhall I ſay in your praiſe ?
Thou wert fair on the hill among thouſands ! he
was terrible in fight. Speak to me; hear my
voice; hear me, ſons of my love! They are
ſilent; ſilent for ever! Cold, cold are their
breaſts of clay! Oh! from the rock on the
hill; from the top of the windy ſteep,
ſpeak, ye ghoſts of the dead ! ſpeak, I will not
be afraid ! Whither are ye gone to reſt? In
what cave of the hill ſhall I find the departed ?
No feeble voice is on the gale : no anſwer half-
drowned in the ſtorm !

{I sit} in my grief! I wait for morning in my
tears! Rear the tomb, ye friends of the dead.
Cloſe it not till Colma come, My life flies
