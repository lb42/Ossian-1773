Thy face was like the ſun after rain ; like the
moon in the ſilence of night; calm as the breaſt
of the lake when the loud wind is laid.

place of thine abode ! With three ſteps I com-
paſs thy grave, O thou who waſt ſo great before !
Four ſtones, with their heads of moſs, are the
only memorial of thee. A tree with ſcarce a
leaf, long graſs, which whiſtles in the wind,

@8 Torman, the ſon of Carthul, lord of I-mora, one of the
weſtern iſles.
