art thou ſad, O Armin, chief of ſea-ſurrounded
Gorma ?

{{Sad}} ! I am ! nor ſmall is my cauſe of woe !
Carmor, thou haſt loſt. Colgar the valiant lives;
and Annira faireſt maid. The boughs of thy
houſe aſcend, O Carmor! but Armin is the laſt
of his race. Dark is thy bed, O Daura ! deep
thy ſleep in the tomb ! When ſhalt thou awake
with thy ſongs? with all thy voice of muſic ?

{Arise}, winds of autumn, ariſe ; blow along
the heath ! ſtreams of the mountains roar ! roar,
tempeſts, in the groves of my oaks! walk
through broken clouds, O moon! ſhow thy
pale face, at intervals! bring to my mind the
night, when all my children fell ; when Arindal
the mighty fell ; when Daura the lovely failed !
Daura, my daughter! thou wert fair; fair as
the moon on Fura @11; white as the driven ſnow ;
ſweet as the breathing gale. Arindal, thy bow
was ſtrong. Thy ſpear was ſwift in the field.
Thy look was like miſt on the wave : thy ſhield,
a red cloud in a ſtorm. Armar, renowned in
war, came, and ſought Daura's love, He was
not long refuſed : fair was the hope of their
friends !
