{Erath}, ſon of Odgal, repined : his brother
had been ſlain by Armor. He came diſguiſed
like a ſon of the ſea: fair was his ſkiff on the
wave ; white his locks of age; calm his ſerious
brow. Faireſt of women, he ſaid, lovely
daughter of Armin! a rock not diſtant in the
ſea, bears a tree on its ſide ; red ſhines the fruit
afar! There Armor waits for Daura. I come to
carry his love ! She went; ſhe called on Armar.
Nought anſwered, but the ſon @12 of the rock,
Armor, my love! my love! why tormenteſt
thou me with fear ? hear, ſon of Arnart, hear :
it is Daura who calleth thee! Erath the traitor
fled laughing to the land. She lifted up her
voice ; ſhe called for her brother and her fa-
ther. Arindal ! Armin ! none to relieve your
Daura !

{Her} voice came over the ſea. Arindal my
ſon deſcended from the hill ; rough in the ſpoils
of the chace. His arrows rattled by his ſide;
his bow was in his hand : five dark grey dogs
attend his ſteps. He ſaw fierce Erath on the
ſhore: he ſeized and bound him to an oak.

@12 By the {{ſon of the rock}} the poet means the ecchoing back of
the human voice from a rock. The vulgar were of opinion,
that this repetition of ſound was made by a ſpirit within the
rock ; and they, on that account called it {{mac talla; the ſon
who dwells in the rock.}}
