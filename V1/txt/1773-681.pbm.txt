216 THE SONGS or SELMA.
--
ariſe : when the north lifts the wave on high; I
ſit by the ſounding ſhore, and look on the fatal
rock. Often by the ſetting moon, I ſee the
ghoſts of my children. Half-viewleſs, they
walk in mournful conference together. Will
none of you ſpeak in pity ? They do not regard
their father. I am ſad, O Carmor, nor ſmall is
my cauſe of woe !

{Such} were the words of the bards in the days
of ſong; when the King heard the muſic of
harps, the tales of other times ! The chiefs ga-
thered from all their hills, and heard the lovely
ſound. They praiſed the voice @14 of Cona ! the
firſt among a thouſand bards! But age is now
on my tongue; my ſoul has failed! I hear,
at times, the ghoſts of bards, and learn their
pleaſant ſong. Bnt memory fails on my mind.
I hear the call of years! They ſay, as they paſs
along, why does Oſſian ſing ? Soon ſhall he be
in the narrow houſe, and no bard thall raiſe his
fame ! Roll on, ye dark-brown years; ye bring
no joy on your courſe! Let the tomb open to
Oſſian, for his ſtrength has failed. The ſons of
ſong are gone to reſt. My voice remains, like
a blaſt, that roars, lonely, on a ſea-ſurrounded
rock, after the winds are laid. The dark moſs
whiſtles there; the diſtant mariner ſees the
waving trees !
