_ARGUMENT to {Book} I._
Cuthullin, (general of the Iriſh tribes, in the minority of
Cormac, king of Ireland) ſitting alone beneath a tree, at the
gate of Tura, a caſtle of Ulſter, (the other chiefs having gone
on a hunting party to Cromla, a neighbouring hill) is in-
formed of the landing of Swaran, king of Lochlin, by Mo-
ran, the ſon of Fithil, one of his ſcouts. He convenes the
chiefs ; a council is held, and diſputes run high about giv-
ing, battle to the enemy. Connal, the petty king of To-
gorma, and an intimate friend of Cuthullin, was for retreat-
ing till Fingal, king of thoſe Caledonians who inhabited the
north-weſt coaſt of Scotland, whoſe aid had been previouſly
ſollicited, ſhould arrive ; but Calmar, the ſon of Matha,
lord of Lara, a country in Connaught, was for engaging the
enemy immediately. Cuthullin, of himſelf willing to fight,
went into the opinion of Calmar. Marching towards the
enemy, he miſſed three of his braveſt heroes, Fergus,
Duchomar, and Cathba. Fergus arriving, tells Cuthullin
of the death of the two other chiefs ; which introduces the
affecting epiſode of Morna, the daughter of Cormac. The
army of Cuthullin is deſcried at a diſtance by Swaran, who
ſent the ſon of Arno to obſerve the motions of the enemy,
while he himſelf ranged his forces in order of battle. The
ſon of Arno returning to Swaran, deſcribes to him Cuthul-
lin's chariot, and the terrible appearance of that hero. The
armies engage, but night coming on, leaves the victory un-
decided. Cuthullin, according to the hoſpitality of the
times, ſends to Swaran a formal invitation to a feaſt, by his
bard Carril, the ſon of Kinfena. Swaran refuſes to come,
Carril relates to Cuthullin the ſtory of Grudar and Braſſolis.
A party, by Connal's advice, is ſent to obſerve the enemy ;
which cloſes the action of the firſt day.
