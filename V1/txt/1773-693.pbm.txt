`` {Arise},” ſays the youth, ``Cuthullin, ariſe.
I ſee the ſhips of the north ! Many, chief of
men, are the foe. Many the heroes of the ſea-
borne Swaran !'' `` Moran!” replied the blue--

Tacitus that one legion only was thought ſufficient, in the time
of Agricola, to reduce the whole iſland under the Roman yoke ;
which would not probably have been the caſe had the iſland
been inhabited for any number of centuries before.

@5 Fingal the ſon of Comhal and Morna the daughter of
Thaddu. His grandfather was Trathal, and great grandfather
Trenmor, both of whom are often mentioned in the poem.
