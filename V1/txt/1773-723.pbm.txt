ſhew their features of war. My ſoul ſhall then
be firm in danger; mine arm like the thunder
of heaven ! But be thou on a moon-beam, O
Morna ! near the window of my reſt; when
my thoughts are of peace; when the din of arms
is paſt. Gather the ſtrength of the tribes ! Move
to the wars of Erin! Attend the car of my
battles! Rejoice in the noiſe of my courſe! Place
three ſpears by my ſide : follow the bounding of
my ſteeds! That my ſoul may be ſtrong in my
friends, when battle darkens round the beams
of my ſteel !

{As} ruſhes a ſtream of foam from the dark ſhady
deep of Cromla; when the thunder is travel-
ling above, and dark-brown night ſits on half the
hill. Through the breaches of the tempeſt look
forth the dim faces of ghoſts. So fierce, ſo vaſt,
ſo terrible ruſhed on the ſons of Erin. The chief
like a whale of ocean, whom all his billows pur-
ſue, poured valour forth, as a ſtream, rolling
his might along the ſhore. The ſons of Loch-
lin heard the noiſe, as the ſound of a winter-
form. Swaran ſtruck his boſſy ſhield: he
called the ſon of Arno, `` What murmur rolls
along the hill, like the gathered flies of the eve?
The ſons of Erin deſcend, or ruſtling winds roar
in the diſtant wood! Such is the noiſe of Gor-
mal, before the white tops of my waves ariſe.
