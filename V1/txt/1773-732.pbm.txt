Book I An EPIC POEM. 233
--
king; ſtrong as the rocks of my land; that
meet the ſtorm, with joy, and ſtretch their dark
pines to the wind !”

{Like} autumn's dark ſtorms, pouring from
two ecchoing hills, toward each other ap-
proached the heroes. Like two deep ſtreams
from high rocks meeting, mixing, roaring on
the plain; loud, rough and dark in battle meet
Lochlin and Innis-fail. Chief mixes his ſtrokes
with chief, and man with man ; ſteel, clanging,
ſounds on ſteel. Helmets are cleft on high.
Blood burſts and ſmokes around. Strings mur-
mur on the poliſhed yews. Darts ruſh along
the ſky. Spears fall like the circles of light,
which gild the face of night. As the noiſe of
the troubled ocean, when roll the waves on
high. As the laſt peal of thunder in heaven,
ſuch is the din of war! Though Cormac's hun-
dred bards were there, to give the fight to ſong;
feeble was the voice of a hundred bards to ſend
the deaths to future times ! For many were the
deaths of heroes; wide poured the blood of
the brave !

{Mourn}, ye ſons of ſong, mourn the death
of the noble Sith&acirc;llin @24. Let the ſighs of Fi&ouml;na
riſe, on the lone plains of her lovely Ardan.
