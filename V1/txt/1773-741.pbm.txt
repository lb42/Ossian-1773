car-borne chief of Erin? Many are the anxious
eyes of their friends, as they ſee them dim on
the heath. But night conceals the chiefs in
clouds, and ends the dreadful ſight !

{It} was on Cromla's ſhaggy ſide that Dorglas
had placed the deer @29; the early fortune of the
chace, before the heroes left the hill. A hundred
youths collect the heath; ten warriors wake the
fire; three hundred chuſe the poliſh'd ſtones.
The feaſt is ſmoaking wide! Cuthullin, chief of
Erin's war, reſumed his mighty ſoul. He ſtood
upon his beamy ſpear, and ſpoke to the ſon of
ſongs ; to Carril of other times, the grey-haired
ſon of Kinfena@30. `` Is this feaſt ſpread ſor me
alone and the king of Lochlin on Erin's ſhore ;
far from the deer of his hills, and ſounding
halls of his feaſts? Riſe, Carril of other times;
carry my words to Swaran. Te!l him from the
roaring of waters, that Cuthullin gives his feaſt.

@29 The ancient manner of preparing feaſts after hunting, is
handed down by tradition. A pit lined with ſmooth ſtones
was made ; and near it ſtood a heap of ſmooth flat ſtones of
the flint kind. The ſtones as well as the pit were properly
heated with heath. Then they laid ſome veniſon in the bot-
tom, and a ſtratum of the ſtones above it; and thus they did
alternately till the pit was full, The whole was covered over
with heath to confine the ſteam. Whether this is probable
I cannot ſay ; but ſome pits are ſhewn, which the vulgar ſay,
were uſed in that manner.
