Pook I. An EPIC POEM. 237
--
Here let him liſten to the ſound of my groves,
amidſt the clouds of night. For cold and bleak
the bluſtering winds ruſh over the foam of his
ſeas. Eere let him praiſe the trembling harp,
and hear the ſongs of heroes !”

{Old} Carril went, with ſofteſt voice. He
called the king of dark-brown ſhields! `` Riſe
from the ſkins of thy chace, riſe, Swaran king
of groves! Cuthullin gives the joy of ſhells.
Partake the feaſt of Erin's blue-eyed chief!”
He anſwered like the ſullen ſound of Cromla
before a ſtorm. `` Though all thy daughters,
Inis-fail! ſhould ſtretch their arms of ſnow;
ſhould raiſe the heavings of their breaſts, and
ſoftly roll their eyes of love; yet, fixed as Loch-
lin's thouſand rocks, here Swaran ſhould remain ;
till morn, with the young beams of the eaſt,
ſhall light me to the death of Cuthullin. Plea-
ſant to my ear is Lochlin's wind ! It ruſhes over
my ſeas ! It ſpeaks aloft in all my ſhrouds, and
brings my green foreſts to my mind: The
green foreſts of Gormal, which often ecchoed
to my winds, when my ſpear was red in the
chace of the boar. Let dark Cuthullin yield to
me the ancient thrones of Cormac; or Erin's
torrents ſhall ſhew from their hills the red foam
of the blood of his pride !”
