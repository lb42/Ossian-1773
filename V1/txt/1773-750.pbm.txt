Book I. An EPIC POEM. 239
--
Golbun's @33 ecchoing heath. Each claimed him
as his own. Death was often at the point of
their ſteel ! Side by ſide the heroes fought ; the
ſtrangers of Ocean fled. Whoſe name was fairer
on the hill, than the name of Cairbar and Gru-
dar! But ah! why ever lowed the bull, on
Golbun's ecchoing heath. They ſaw him leaping
like ſnow. The wrath of the chiefs returned !”

``{On} Lubar's@34 graſſy banks they fought ;
Grudar fell in his blood. Fierce Cairbar came
to the vale, where Braſſolis @35, faireſt of his
ſiſters, all alone, raiſed the ſong of grief. She
ſang of the actions of Grudar, the youth of her
ſecret ſoul! She mourned him in the field of
blood ; but ſtill ſhe hoped for his return. Her
white boſom is ſeen from her robe, as the moon
from the clouds of night, when its edge heaves
white on the view, from the darkneſs, which
covers its orb. Her voice was ſofter than the
harp to raiſe the ſong of grief. Her ſoul was
fixed on Grudar. The ſecret look of her eye
was his. ``When ſhalt thou come in thine arms,
thou mighty in the war?”

``{Take}, Braſſiolis,” Cairbar came and ſaid,
`` take, Braſſiolis, this ſhield of blood. Fix it
