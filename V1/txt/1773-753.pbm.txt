on high within my hall, the armour of my foe !
Her ſoft heart beat againſt her ſide. Diſtracted,
pale, ſhe flew. She ſound her youth in all his
blood; ſhe died on Cromla's heath. Here reſts
their duſt, Cuthullin ; theſe lonely yews ſprung
from their tombs, and ſhade them from the ſtorm.
Fair was Braſſolis on the plain! Stately was
Grudar on the hill ! The bard thall preſerve their
names, and ſend them down to future times !”

``{Pleasant} is thy voice, O Carril,” ſaid
the blue-eyed chief of Erin. ``Pleaſant are the
words of other times! They are like the calm
ſhower of ſpring; when the ſun looks on the
field, and the light cloud flies over the hills. O
ſtrike the harp in praiſe of my love, the lonely
fun-beam of Dunſcaith. Strike the harp in the
praiſe of Bragéla ; ſhe that I left in the Iſle of
Miſt, the ſpouſe of Semo's ſon! Doſt thou raiſe
thy fair face from the rock to find the ſails of
Cuthullin? The ſea is rolling diſtant far ; its
white foam deceives thee for my ſails. Retire,
for it is night, my love; the dark winds ſign in
thy hair. Retire to the halls of my feaſts ; think
of the times that are paſt. I will not return till
the ſtorm of war is ceaſed. O Connal, ſpeak of
war and arms, and ſend her from my mind.
Lovely with her flowing hair is the white-
boſomed daughter of Sorglan,”
