Book I. An EPIC POEM. 241
--
{Connal}, ſlow to ſpeak, replied, `` Guard
againſt the race of Ocean. Send thy troop of
night abroad, and watch the ſtrength of Swaran.
Cuthullin ! I am for peace till the race of Selma
come; till Fingal come, the firſt of men, and
beam, like the ſun, on our fields !” The hero
ſtruck the ſhield of alarms, the warriors of the
night moved on! The reſt lay in the heath of
the deer, and ſlept bcneath the duſky wind.
The ghoſts @36 of the lately dead were near, and
ſwam on the gloomy clouds: And far diſtant,
in the dark ſilence of Lena, the feeble voices of
death were faintly heard.
==
@36 It was long the opinion of the ancient Scots, that a ghoſt
was heard ſhrieking near the place where a death was to hap-
pen ſoon after. The accounts given, to this day, amorg the
vulzar, of this extraordinary matter, are very poetical, The
ghoſt comes mounted on a meteor, and ſurrounds twice or
thrice the place deſtined for the perſon to die; and then goes
along the road through which the funeral is to paſs, ſhrieking
at intervals; at laſt, the meteor and ghoſt diſappear above the
burial place.
