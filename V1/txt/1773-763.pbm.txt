_ARGUMENT to {Book} II._
The ghoſt of Crugal, one of the Iriſh heroes who was killed
in battle, appearing to Connal, foretels the defeat of
Cuthullin in the next battle; and earneſtly adviſes him to
make peace with Swaran. Connal communicates the
viſion; but Cuthullin is inflexible; from a principle of
honour he would not be the firſt to ſue for peace, and he
reſolved to continue the war. Morning comes; Swaran
propoſes diſhonourable terms to Cuthullin, which are re-
jected. The battle begins, and is obſtinately fought for
ſome time, until, upon the flight of Grumal, the whole
Iriſh army gave way. Cuthullin and Connal cover their
retreat: Carril leads them to a neighbouring hill, whither
they are ſoon followed by Cuthullin himſelf, who deſcries
the fleet of Fingal making towards the coaſt; but, night
coming on, he loſt fight of it again. Cuthullin, dejected
after his defeat, attributes his ill ſucceſs to the death of
Ferda his friend, whom he had killed ſome time before.
Carril, to ſhew that ill ſucceſs did not always attend thoſe
who innocently killed their friends, introduces the epiſode
of Comal and Galvina.
