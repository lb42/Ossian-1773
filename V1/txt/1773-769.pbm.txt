moon. His robes are of the clouds of the hill.
His eyes are two decaying flames ! Dark is the
wound of his breaſt! ``Crugal,” ſaid the
mighty Connal, ſon of Dedgal famed on the hill
of hinds ! ``Why ſo pale and ſad, thou breaker
of the ſhields? Thou haſt never been pale for
ſear! What diſturbs the departed Crugal?”
Dim, and in tears, he ſtood and ſtretched his
pale hand over the hero. Faintly he raiſed his
feeble voice, like the gale of the reedy Lego !

`` {My} ſpirit, Connal, is on my hills: my
corſe on the ſands of Erin. Thou ſhalt never
talk with Crugal, nor find his lone ſteps in the
heath. I am light as the blaſt of Cromla. I
move like the ſhadow of miſt ! Connal, ſon of
Colgar, I ſee a cloud of death: it hovers dark
over the plains of Lena. The ſons of green
Erin muſt fall. Remove from the field of
ghoſts.” Like the darkened moon he retired,
in the midſt of the whiſtling blaſt. ``Stay,”
ſaid the mighty Connal, `` ſtay my dark-red
friend. Lay by that beam of heaven, ſon of
the windy Cromla! What cave is thy lonely
houſe ? What green-headed hill the place of thy
repoſe ? Shall we not hear thee in the ſtorm ?
In the noiſe of the mountain-ſtream? When the
feeble ſons of the wind come forth, and ſcarcely
ſeen, paſs over the deſart ?”
