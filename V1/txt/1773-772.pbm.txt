Book II. An EPIC POEM. 247
--
{The} ſoft-voiced Connal rofe, in the midſt of
his ſounding arms. He ſtruck his ſhield above
Cuthullin. The ſon of battle waked. `` Why,”
ſaid the ruler of the car, `` comes Connal
through my night? My ſpear might turn
againſt the ſound; and Cuthullin mourn the
death of his friend. Speak, Connal; ſon of
Colgar, ſpeak, thy counſel is the ſun of hea-
ven!” ``Son of Semo!” replied the chief,
`` the ghoſt of Crugal came from his cave. The
ſtars dim-twinkled through his form. His
voice was like the ſound of a diſtant ſtream.
He is a meſſenger of death ! He ſpeaks of the
dark and narrow houſe ! Sue for peace, O chief
of Erin ! or fly over the heath of Lena.”

``{He} ſpoke to Connal,” replied the hero,
``though ſtars dim-twinkled through his form !
Son of Colgar, it was the wind that murmured
acroſs thy ear. Or if it was the form @2 of Cru-
gal, why didſt thou not force him to my ſight ?
Haſt thou enquired where is his cave? The houſe
of that ſon of wind ? My ſword might find that
voice, and force his knowlege from Crugal.

@2 The poet teaches us the opinions that prevailed in his
time concerning the fate of ſeparate ſouls. From Connal's
expreſſion, ``That the ſtars dim-twinkled through the form
of Crugal,” and Cuthullin's reply, we may gather that they
both thought the ſoul was material, ſomething like the
{{εἰδωλον}} of the ancient Greeks.
