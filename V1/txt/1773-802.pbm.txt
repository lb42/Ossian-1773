plain of Muri. Our ſwords avoid a wound.
They ſlide on the helmets of ſteel ; or ſound on
the ſlippery ſhields. Deugala was near with a

arm is feeble, ſun-beam of youth ! Thy years
are not ſtrong for ſteel. Yield to the fon of
Semo. He is a rock on Malmor.”
`` {The} tear is in the eye of youth. He faulter-
ing ſaid to me: `` Cuthullin, raiſe thy boſſy
ſhield. Defend thee from the hand of thy friend.
My ſoul is laden with grief: for I muſt ſlay the
chief of men !” I ſighed as the wind in the cleft

lin's friends ! Unhappy is the hand of Cuthullin
ſince the hero fell !

`` {Mournful} is thy tale, ſon of the car,”
ſaid Carril of other times. `` It ſends my ſoul
back to the ages of old, to the days of other
years. Often have I heard of Comal, who ſlew
the friend he loved ; yet victory attended his
ſteel: the battle was conſumed in his preſence !
