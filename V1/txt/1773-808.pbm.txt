Book II. An EPIC POEM. 259
--
I will reſt among the arms ; but ſoon return,
my love !”

{He} went to the deer of Mora. The daughter
of Conloch would try his love. She cloathed
her fair ſides with his armour ; ſhe ſtrode fron
the cave of Ronan! He thought it was his foe.
His heart beat high. His colour changed, and
darkneſs dimmed his eyes. He drew the bow.
The arrow flew. Galbina fell in blood ! He run
with wildneſs in his ſteps : he called the daughter
of Conloch. No anſwer in the lonely rock.
Where art thou, O my love? He ſaw, at length,
her heaving heart, beating around the arrow
he threw. `` O Conloch's daughter, is it thou?
He ſunk upon her breaſt! The hunters ſound
the hapleſs pair; he afterwards walked the hill.
But many and ſilent were his ſteps round the
dark dwelling of his love. The fleet of the ocean
came. He fought, the ſtrangers fled. He
ſearched for death along the field. But who
could ſlay the mighty Comhal ! He threw away
his dark-brown ſhield. An arrow ſound his
manly breaſt. He ſleeps with his loved Galbina
at the noiſe of the ſounding ſurge ! Their green
tombs are ſeen by the mariner, when he bounds
on the waves of the north.
