_ARGUMENT to Book III._
Cuthullin, pleaſed with the ſtory of Carril, inſiſts with that
bard for more of his ſongs. He relates the actions of Fingal
in Lochlin, and death of Agandecca the beautiful ſiſter of
Swaran. He had ſcarce finiſhed when Calmar the ſon of
Matha, who had adviſed the firſt battle, came wounded
from the field, and told them of Swaran's deſign to ſurpriſe
the remains of the Iriſh army. He himſelf propoſes to
withſtand ſingly the whole force of the enemy, in a narrow
paſs, till the Iriſh ſhould make good their retreat, Cuthul-
lin, touched with the gallant propoſal of Calmar, reſolves
to accompany him, and orders Carril to carry off the few
that remained of the Iriſh. Morning comes, Calmar dies
of his wounds ; and, the ſhips of the Caledonians appear-
ing, Swaran gives over the purſuit of the Iriſh, and returns
to oppoſe Fingal's landing. Cuthullin aſhamed, after his
defeat, to appear before Fingal, retires to the cave of Tura.
Fingal engages the enemy, puts them to flight; but the
coming on of night makes the victory not deciſive, The
King, who had obſerved the gallant behaviour of his grand-
ſon Oſcar, gives him advices concerning his conduct in
peace and war. He recommends to him to place the exam-
ple of his fathers before his eyes, as the beſt model for his
conduct ; which introduces the epiſode concerning Faina-
ſollis, the daughter of the king of Craca, whom Fingal had
taken under his protection, in his youth. Fillan and Oſcar
are diſpatched to obſerve the motions of the enemy by night ;
Gaul the ſon of Morni deſires the command of the army, in
the next battle; which Fingal promiſes to give him. Some
general reflections of the poet cloſe the third day.
