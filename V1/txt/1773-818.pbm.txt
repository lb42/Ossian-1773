_FINGAL,
AN ANCIENT
EPIC POEM.
In SIX BOOKS.
BOOK III._@1

``{Pleasant} are the words of the ſong,”
ſaid Cuthullin ! `` lovely the talcs of other
times! They are, like the calm dew of the
morning on the hill of roes; when the ſun is
faint on its ſide, and the lake is ſettled and blue
in the vale. O Carril, raiſe again thy voice ;
let me hear the ſong of Selma : which was ſung
in my halls of joy, when Fingal king of ſhields
was there, and glowed at the deeds of his fathers.”

``{Fingal}! thou dweller of battle,” ſaid Car-
ril, `` early were thy deeds in arms. Lochlin

@1 The ſecond night, ſince the opening of the poem, conti-
nues ; and Cuthullin, Connal, and Carril ſtill ſit in the place
deſcribed in the preceding book. The ſtory of Agandecca is
introduced here with propriety, as great uſe is made of it in the
courſe of the poem, and as it, in ſome meaſure, brings about
the cataſtrophe.
