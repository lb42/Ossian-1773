Book III. An EPIC POEM, 367
--
with looſely flowing locks. Her white breaſt
heaved with broken ſighs, like the foam of the
ſtreamy Lubar. Starno pierced her ſide with
ſteel. She fell, like a wreath of ſnow, which
ſlides from the rocks of Ronan ; when the woods
are ſtill, and eccho deepens in the vale ! Then
Fingal eyed his valiant chiefs, his valiant Chiefs
took arms. The gloom of battle roared ; Loch-
lin fled or died. Pale, in his bounding ſhip he
cloſed the maid of the ſofteſt ſoul. Her tomb
aſcends on Ardven; the ſea roars round her
narrow dwelling.

`` {Blessed} be her ſoul,” ſaid Cuthullin ;
``bleſſed be the mouth of the ſong! Strong
was the youth of Fingal; ſtrong is his arm of
age. Lochlin ſhall fall again before the king of
ecchoing Morven. Shew thy face from a
cloud, O moon; light his white ſails on the
wave: And if any ſtrong ſpirit @5 of heaven ſits
on that low-hung cloud; turn his dark ſhips
from the rock, thou rider of the ſtorm !

@5 This is the only paſſage in the poem that has the appear-
ance of religion. But Cuthullin's apoſtrophe to this ſpirit is
accompanied with a doubt, ſo that it is not eaſy to determine
whether the hero meant a ſuperior being, or the ghoſts of
deceaſed warriors, who were ſuppoſed in thoſe times to rule
the ſtorms, and to tranſport themſelves in a guſt of wind from
one country to another.
