{Morning} is grey on Cromla. The ſons of
the ſea aſcend. Calmar ſtood forth to meet
them in the pride of his kindling ſoul. But
pale was the face of the chief. He leaned on his
father's ſpear. That ſpear which he brought

ſad ; the ſoul of the lonely Alcletha, waining in
the ſorrow of years. But ſlowly now the hero
falls, like a tree on the plain. Dark Cuthullin
ſtands alone like a rock in a ſandy vale. The ſea
comes with its waves, and roars on its hardened
ſides. Its head is covered with foam ; the hills
are ecchoing around.

white-ſailed ſhips of Fingal appear. High is the
grove of their maſts, as they nod, by turns, on
the rolling wave. Swaran ſaw them from the
hill. He returned from the ſons of Erin. As
ebbs the reſounding ſea, through the hundred
iſles of Iniſtore; ſo loud, ſo vaſt, ſo imennſe
returned the ſons of Lochlin againſt the king.
But bending, weeping, ſad, and ſlow, and
dragging his long ſpear behind, Cuthullin ſunk
in Cromla's wood, and mourned his fallen
friends. He feared the face of Fingal, who was
wont to greet him from the fields of renown !
