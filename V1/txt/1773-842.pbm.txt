Book III. An EPIC POEM. 271
--
``{How} many lie there of my heroes! the
chiefs of Erin's race! they that were chearful
in the hall, when the ſound of the ſhells aroſe !
No more ſhall I find their ſteps in the heath.
No more ſhall I hear their voice in the chace.
Pale, ſilent, low on bloody beds, are they who
were my friends! O ſpirits of the lately dead,
meet Cuthullin on his heath. Speak to him
on the wind, when the ruſtling tree of Tura's
cave reſounds. There, far remote, I ſhall lie
unknown. No bard ſhall hear of me. No grey
tone ſhall riſe to my renown. Mourn me with
the dead, O Bragela ! departed is my fame.”
Such were the words of Cuthullin, when he ſunk
in the woods of Cromla !

{Fingal}, tall in his ſhip, ſtretched his bright
lance before him. Terrible was the gleam of the
ſteel : it was like the green meteor of death, ſet-
ting in the heath of Malmor, when the traveller
is alone, and the broad moon is darkened in
heaven.

``{The} battle is paſt,” ſaid the king, `` I
behold the blood of my friends. Sad is the
heath of Lena! mournful the oaks of Cromla.
The hunters have fallen in their ſtrength : the
ſon of Semo is no more. Ryno and Fillan, my
ſons, ſound the horn of Fingal. Aſcend that
hill on the ſhore; call the children of the foe.
