peared far off; we ſaw it like a miſt, that rode
on ocean's wind. It ſoon approached. We ſaw

chief of Sora will fly, if Fingal's arm is like his
ſoul. In ſome lone cave I might conceal thee,
daughter of the ſea! But Fingal never flies.
Where the danger threatens, I rejoice in the
ſtorm of ſpears.” I ſaw the tears upon her
