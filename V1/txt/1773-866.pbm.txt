Book III. An EPIC POEM. 279
--
be near, to aid thee in the midſt of danger.
Raiſe, raiſe the voice, ye ſons of ſong, and lull
me into reſt. Here will Fingal lie, amidſt the
wind of night. And if thou, Agandecca, art
near, among the children of thy land ; if thou
ſitteſt on a blaſt of wind, among the high-
ſhrowded maſts of Lochlin; come to my
dreams @8, my fair one. Shew thy bright face
to my ſoul.”

{Many} a voice and many a harp, in tuneful
ſounds aroſe. Of Fingal's noble deeds they
ſung ; of Fingal's noble race: And ſometimes,
on the lovely ſound, was heard the name of
Oſſian. I often fought, and often won, in
battles of the ſpear. But blind, and tearful, and
forlorn I walk with little men! O Fingal, with
thy race of war I now behold thee not! The
wild roes feed on the green tomb of the mighty
king of Morven! Bleſt be thy ſoul, thou king
of ſwords, thou moſt renowned on the hills of
Cona !
