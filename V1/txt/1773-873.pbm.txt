_ARGUMENT to Book IV._
The action of the poem being ſuſpended by night, Oſſian
takes that opportunity to relate his own actions at the lake
of Lego, and his courtſhip of Evirallin, who was the mo-
ther of Oſcar, and had died ſome time before the expedition
of Fingal into Ireland. Her ghoſt appears to him, and tells him
that Oſcar, who had been ſent, the beginning of the night,
to obſerve the enemy, was engaged with an advanced party,
and almoſt overpowered. Oſſian relieves his ſon; and an
alarm is given to Fingal of the approach of Swaran. The
king riſes, calls his army together, and, as he had pro-
miſed the preceding night, devolves the command on Gaul
the ſon of Morni, while he himſelf, after charging his ſons
to behave gallantly and defend his people, retires to a hill,
from whence he could have a view of the battle. The battle
joins; the poet relates Oſcar's great actions. But when
Oſcar, in conjunction with his father, conquered in one
wing, Gaul, who was attacked by Swaran in perſon, was
on the point of retreating in the other. Fingal ſends Ullin
his bard to encourage him with a war ſong, but notwith-
ſtanding Swaran prevails; and Gaul and his army are
obliged to give way. Fingal, deſcending from the hill,
rallies them again: Swaran deſiſts from the purſuit, poſ-
ſeſſes himſelf of a riſing ground, reſtores the ranks, and
waits the approach of Fingal. The king, having encou-
raged his men, gives the neceſſary orders, and renews the
battle. Cuthullin, who, with his friend Connal, and
Carril his bard, had retired to the cave of Tura, hearing
the noiſe, came to the brow of the hill, which overlooked
the field of battle, where he ſaw Fingal engaged with the
enemy. He, being hindered by Connal from joining
Fingal, who was himſelf upon the point of obtaining a
complete victory, ſends Carril to congratulate that hero on
his ſucceſs.
