Book IV. An EPIC POEM. 285

Colla ; there Durra of wounds, there mighty
Toſcar, and Tago, there Freſtal the victorious
ſtood ; Dairo of the happy deeds: Dala the
battle's bulwark in the narrow way ! The ſword
flamed in the hand of Cormac. Graceful was
the look of the hero! Eight were the heroes of
Oſſian. Ullin ſtormy fon of-war. Mullo of the
generous deeds. The noble, the graceful Sce-
lacha, Oglan, and Cerdal the wrathful. Du-
mariccan's brows of death! And why ſhould
Ogar be the laſt; ſo wide renowned on the hills
of Ardven ?”

`` {Ogar} met Dala the ſtrong, face to face, on
the field of heroes. The battle of the chiefs was,
like wind, on ocean's foamy waves. The dag-
ger is remembered by Ogar ; the weapon which
he loved. Nine times he drowned it in Dela's
ſide. The ſtormy battle turned. Three times I
broke on Cormac's ſhield : three times he broke
his ſpear. But, unhappy youth of love! I cut
his head away. Five times I ſhook it by the
lock. The friends of Cormac fled. Whoever
would have told me, lovely maid, when then I
ſtrove in battle; that blind, forſaken, and for-
lorn I now ſhould paſs the night; firm ought
his mail to have been; unmatched his arm in
war !”
