{On} @2 Lena's gloomy heath, the voice of muſic
died away. The unconſtant blaſt blew hard,
The high oak ſhook its leaves around. Of Eve-
rallin were my thoughts, when in all the light
of beauty ſhe came. Her blue eyes rolling in
tears. She ſtood on a cloud before my ſight,
and ſpoke with feeble voice ! ``Riſe, Oſſian,
riſe and ſave my ſon; ſave Oſcar prince of men.
Near the red oak of Luba's ſtream, he fights
with Lochlin's ſons.” She ſunk into her cloud
again, I covered me with ſteel. My ſpear ſup-
ported my ſteps; my rattling armour rung. I
hummed, as I was wont in danger, the ſongs of
heroes of old. Like diſtant thunder Lochlin
heard. They fled ; my ſon purſued.”

`` {I called} him like a diſtant ſtream. Oſcar
return over Lena. `` No further purſue the
foe,” I ſaid, `` though Oſſian is behind thee.”
He came ; and pleaſant to my ear was Oſcars
ſounding ſteel. `` Why didſt thou ſtop my
hand,” he ſaid, `` till death had covered all ?
For dark and dreadful by the ſtream they met

@2 The poet returns to his ſubject. If one could fix the time
of the year in which the action of the poem happened, from
the ſcene deſcribed here, I ſhould be tempted to place it in
autumn. The trees ſhed their leaves, and the winds are vari-
able, both which circumſtances agree with that ſeaſon of the
year.
