Book IV. An EPIC POEM. 289

warriors : while the ſon of Morni fights, the
chief of mighty men ! He ſhall lead my battle;
that his fame may riſe in ſong! O ye ghoſts of
heroes dead ! ye riders of the ſtorm of Cromla !
receive my falling people with joy, and bear
them to four hills. And may the blaſt of Lena
carry them over my ſeas, that they may come to
my ſilent dreams, and delight my ſoul in reſt!
Fillan and Oſcar, of the dark-brown hair ! fair
Ryno, with the pointed ſteel! advance with va-
lour to the fight. Behold the ſon of Morni !
Let your ſwords be like his in ſtrife ; behold the
deeds of his hands. Protect the friends of your
father. Remember the chiefs of old. My chil-
dren, I will ſee you yet, though here ye ſhould
fall in Erin. Soon ſhall our cold, pale ghoſts
meet in a cloud on Cona's eddying winds.”

{Now} like a dark and ſtormy cloud, edged
round with the red lightning of heaven ; flying
weſtward from the morning's beam, the king of
Selma removed. Terrible is the light of his ar-
mour ; two ſpears are in his hand. His grey
hair falls on the wind. He often looks back on
the war. Three bards attend the ſon of ſame,
to bear his words to the chiefs. High on
Cromla's ſide he ſat, waving the lightning of his
ſword, and as he waved we moved.
