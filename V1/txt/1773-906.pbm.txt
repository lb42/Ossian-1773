Book IV, An EPIC POEM 293
--
rible king of Morven. He ſtopped in the midſt
of his courſe. Dark he leaned on his ſpear,
rolling his red eyes around. Silent and tall he
ſeemed as an oak on the banks of Lubar, which
had its branches blaſted of old by the lightning
of heaven. It bends over the ſtream : the grey
moſs whiſtles in the wind: ſo ſtood the king.
Then ſlowly he retired to the riſing heath of
Lena. His thouſands pour around the hero.
Darkneſs gathers on the hill ! 

{Fingal}, like a beam from heaven, ſhone in
the midſt of his people. His heroes gather
around him. He ſends forth the voice of his
power. `` Raiſe my ſtandards on high ; ſpread
them on Lena's wind, like the flames of an hun-
dred hills! Let them ſound on the winds of
Erin, and remind us of the fight. Ye ſons of
the roaring ſtreams, that pour from a thouſand
hills, be near the king of Morven ! attend to
the words of his power ! Gaul ſtrongeſt arm of
death ! O Oſcar, of the future fights! Connal,
ſon of the blue ſhields of Sora ! Dermid of the
dark-brown hair ! Oſſian king of many ſongs,
be near your father's arm !” We reared the ſun-
beam @4 of battle; the ſtandard of the king!
==
@4 Fingal's ſtandard was diſtinguiſhed by the name of {{ſun-
beam}} ; probably on account of its bright colour, and its being
ſtudded with gold. To begin a battle is expreſſed, in old
compoſition, by {{lifting of the ſun beam}}.
