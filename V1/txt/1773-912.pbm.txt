Book IV. An EPIC POEM. 295
--
ſons of Selma advanced, Cromla ecchoed
around! How can I relate the deaths, when
we cloſed in the ſtrife of arms! O daugh-
ter of Toſcar ! bloody were our hands! The
gloomy ranks of Lochlin ſell, like the banks of
the roaring Cona! Our arms were victorious on
Lena : each chief fulfilled his promiſe ! Beſide
the murmur of Branno thou didſt often ſit, O
maid ! thy white boſom roſe ſrequent, like the
down of the ſwan when ſlow ſhe ſwims on the
lake, and ſidelong winds blow on her ruffled
wing. Thou haſt ſeen the ſun retire, red and
flow behind his cloud : night gathering round on
the mountain, while the unfrequent blaſt roared
in the narrow vales. At length the rain beats
hard: thunder rolls in peals. Lightning glances
on the rocks! Spirits ride on beams of fire ! The
ſtrength of the mountain-ſtreams comes roaring
down the hills. Such was the noiſe of battle,
maid of the arms of ſnow ! Why, daughter of
Toſcar, why that tear? The maids of Lochlin
have cauſe to weep ! The people of their coun-
try fell. Bloody were the blue ſwords of the
race of my heroes ! But I am ſad, forlorn, and
blind: no more the companion of heroes.
Give, lovely maid, to me thy tears. I have
ſeen the tombs of all my friends |
