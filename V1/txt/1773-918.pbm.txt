Book IV. An EPIC POEM. 297
--
``{Then}, Carril, go,” replied the chief,
``go greet the king of Morven. When Loch-
lin falls away like a ſtream after rain: when the
noiſe of the battle is paſt. Then be thy voice
ſweet in his ear to praiſe the king of Selma !
Give him the ſword of Caithbat. Cuthullin is
not worthy to lift the arms of his fathers ! Come,
O ye ghoſts of the lonely Cromla ! ye ſouls of
chiefs that are no more ! be near the ſteps of
Cuthullin; talk to him in the cave of his grief.
Never more ſhall I be renowned, among the
mighty in the land. I am a beam that has
ſhone ; a miſt that has fled away : when the blaſt
of the morning came, and brightened the ſhaggy
ſide of the hill! Connal ! talk of arms no more :
departed is my fame. My ſighs ſhall be on
Cromla's wind ; till my footſteps ceaſe to be
ſeen. And thou, white-boſom'd Bragela, mourn
over the fall of my fame: vanquiſhed, I will ne-
ver return to thee, thou ſun-beam of my ſoul !”
