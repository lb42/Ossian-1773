_ARGUMENT to Book V_
Cuthullin and Connal ſtill remain on the hill. Fingal and
Swaran meet; the combat is deſcribed. Swaran is over-
come, bound and delivered over as a priſoner to the care of
Oſſian and Gaul the ſon of Morni ; Fingal, his younger ſons,
and Oſcar, ſtill purſue the enemy. The epiſode of Orla a
Chief of Lochlin, who was mortally wounded in the battle,
is introduced. Fingal, touched with the death of Orla, or-
ders the purſuit to be diſcontinued; and calling his ſons to-
gether, he is informed that Ryno, the youngeſt of them,
was ſlain. He laments his death, hears the ſtory of Lamdarg
and Gelchoſſa, and returns towards the place where he had
left Swaran. Carril, who had been ſent by Cuthullin to
congratulate Fingal on his victory, comes in the mean time
to Oſſian. The converſation of the two poets cloſes the
action of the fourth day.
