torn from all their rocks! Happy are thy people,
O Fingal! thine arm ſhall finiſh their wars.
Thou art the firſt in their dangers : the wiſeſt in
the days of their peace. Thou ſpeakeſt and thy
thouſands obey : armies tremble at the ſound of
thy ſteel. Happy are thy people, O Fingal,
king of reſounding Selma ! Who is that ſo dark
and terrible coming in the thunder of his courſe?
who but Starno's ſon to meet the king of Mor-
ven? Behold the battle of the chiefs ! it is the
ſtorm of the ocean, when two ſpirits meet
far diſtant, and contend for the rolling of
waves. The hunter hears the noiſe on his hill.
He ſees the high billows advancing to Ardven's
ſhore !

{Such} were the words of Connal, when the
heroes met, in ſight. There was the clang of
arms ! there every blow, like the hundred ham-
mers of the furnace ! Terrible is the battle of
the Kings; dreadful the look of their eyes. Their
dark-brown ſhields are cleft in twain. Their
ſteel flies, broken, from their helms. They
fling their weapons down. Each ruſhes to his
hero's graſp: Their ſinewy arms bend round
each other: they turn from ſide to ſide, and
train and ſtretch their large ſpreading limbs
below. But when the pride of their ſtrength
aroſe, they ſhook the hill with their heels.
