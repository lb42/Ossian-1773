``{Here},” ſaid the bard of ſong, `` here reſt
the firſt of heroes. Silent is Lamderg @1 in this
place: dumb is Ullin, king of ſwords: And
who, ſoft ſmiling from her cloud, ſhews me
her face of love? Why, daughter, why ſo pale
art thou, firſt of the maids of Cromla ? Doſt
thou ſleep with the foes in battle, white-boſomed
daughter of Tuathal? Thou haſt been the love
of thouſands, but Lamderg was thy love. He

my love, the daughter of the noble Tuathal? I
left her in the hall of Tura, when I fought with
great Ulfada. Return ſoon, O Lamderg, ſhe
ſaid, for here I fit in grief. Her white breaſt
roſe with ſighs. Her cheek was wet with tears.
But I ſee her not coming to meet me; to ſooth
my ſoul after war. Silent is the hall of my joy !
