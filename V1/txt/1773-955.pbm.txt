thou,” ſaid terrible Ullin,`` daughter of the ge-
nerous Tuathal. I carry thee to Cairbar's halls.
The valiant ſhall have Gelchoſſa. Three days
I remain on Cramla, to wait that ſon of battle,
Lamderg. On the fourth Gelchoſſa is mine; if
the mighty Lamderg flies.”

``{Allad} !” ſaid the chief of Cromla, ``peace
to thy dreams in the cave. Ferchios, ſound the
horn of Lamderg, that Ullin may hear in his
halls. Lamderg, like a roaring ſtorm, aſ-

ſurly ſong as he went, like the noiſe of a falling
ſtream, He darkly ſtood upon the hill, like a
cloud varying its form to the wind, He rolled

bar's hall. The hero heard, with joy, his foe.
He took his father's ſpear. A ſmile brightens
his dark-brown cheek, as he places his ſword by
his ſide. The dagger glittered in his hand. He
whiſtled as he went.
