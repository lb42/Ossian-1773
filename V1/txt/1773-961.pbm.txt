the hills. They have fallen like the oak of the
deſart ; when it lies acroſs a ſtream, and withers
in the wind. Oſcar ! chief of every youth! thou
ſeeſt how they have fallen. Be thou like them,
on earth renowned. Like them the ſong of
bards. Terrible were their forms in battle ; but
calm was Ryno in the days of peace. He was
like the bow of the ſhower ſeen far diſtant on
the ſtream ; when the ſun is ſetting on Mora;
when ſilence dwells on the hill of deer. Reſt,
youngeſt of my ſons! reſt, O Ryno, on Lena.
We too ſhall be no more. Warriors one day
muſt fall!” !

{Such} was thy grief, thou king of ſwords,
when Ryno lay on earth. What muſt the grief
of Oſſian be, for thou thyſelf art gone ! I hear
not thy diſtant voice on Cona. My eyes per-
ceive thee not. Often forlorn and dark I ſit at
thy tomb; and feel it with my hands. When I
think I hear thy voice, it is but the paſſing blaſt.
Fingal has long ſince fallen aſleep, the ruler of
the war !

{Then} Gaul and Oſſian ſat with Swaran, on
the ſoft green banks of Lubar. I touched the
harp to pleaſe the king. But gloomy was his
brow. He rolled his red eyes towards Lena.
The hero mourned his hoſt. I raiſed mine eyes
to Cromla's brow, I ſaw the ſon of generous
--
Semo.
