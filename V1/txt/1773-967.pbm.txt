have I touched the harp to lovely Evirallin.
Thou too haſt often joined my voice, in Branno's
hall of generous ſhells. And often, amidſt our
voices, was heard the mildeſt Evirallin. One
day ſhe ſung of Cormac's fall, the youth, who
died for her love. I ſaw the tears on her cheek,
and on thine, thou chief of men ! Her ſoul was
touched for the unhappy, though ſhe loved him
not. How fair among a thouſand maids, was
the daughter of generous Branno !”

``{Bring} not, Carril,” I replied, `` bring
not her memory to my mind. My ſoul muſt
melt at the remembrance. My eyes muſt have
their tears. Pale in the earth is ſhe, the ſoftly-
bluſhing fair of my love ! But ſit thou on the
heath, O bard, and let us hear thy voice. It is
pleaſant as the gale of ſpring, that ſighs on the
hunter's ear; when he awakens from dreams of
joy, and has heard the muſic of the ſpirits of
the hill !”
