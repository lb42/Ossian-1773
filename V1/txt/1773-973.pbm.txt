_ARGUMENT to Book VI._
Night comes on. Fingal gives a feaſt to his army, at which
Swaran is preſent. The king commands Ullin his bard to
give the {{ſong of peace}}; a cuſtom always obſerved at the end
of a war. Ullin relates the actions of Trenmor, great
grandfather to Fingal, in Scandinavia, and his marriage
with Inibaca, the daughter of a king of Lochlin who was
anceſtor to Swaran ; which conſideration, together with his
being brother to Agandecca, with whom Fingal was in love
in his youth, induced the king to releaſe him, and permit
him to return, with the remains of his army, into Lochlin,
upon his promiſe of never returning to Ireland, in a hoſtile
manner. The night is ſpent in ſettling Swaran's departure,
in ſongs of bards, and in a converſation in which the ſtory
of Grumal is introduced by Fingal. Morning comes.
Swaran departs; Fingal goes on a hunting party, and find-
ing Cuthullin in the cave of Tura, comforts him, and ſets
ſail, the next day, for Scotland; which concludes the
poem.
