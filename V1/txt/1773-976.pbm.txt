_FINGAL,
AN ANCIENT
EPIC POEM.
In SIX BOOKS.
BOOK VI._

Darkneſs reſts on the ſteeps of Cromla.

Erin's waves: they ſhew their heads of fire,
through the flying miſt of heaven. A diſtant
wind roars in the wood. Silent and dark is the
plain of death ! Still on the duſky Lena aroſe in

friends of our youth; the days of former years !
when we met on the banks of Lego: when
we ſent round the joy of the ſhell. Cromla,
anſwered to his voice. The ghoſts of thoſe he
ſung came in their ruſtling winds. They were
ſeen to bend with joy, towards the ſound of their
praiſe !
