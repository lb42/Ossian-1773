{Be} thy ſoul bleſt, O Carril, in the midſt of
thy eddying winds. O that thou wouldſt come
to my hall, when I am alone by night! And
thou doſt come, my friend, I hear often thy
light hand on my harp ; when it hangs, on the
diſtant wall, and the feeble ſound touches my
ear. Why doſt thou not ſpeak to me in my
grief, and tell when I ſhall behold my friends ?
But thou paſſeſt away in thy murmuring blaſt ;
the wind whiſtles thro' the grey hair of Oſſian !

Now, on the ſide of Mora, the heroes ga-
thered to the feaſt. A thouſand aged oaks are
burning to the wind. The ſtrength@1 of the
ſhells goes round. The ſouls of warriors brighten
with joy. But the king of Lochlin is ſilent.
Sorrow reddens in the eyes of his pride. He
often turned toward Lena. He remembered that
he fell. Fingal leaned on the ſhield of his fa-
thers. His grey locks ſlowly waved on the wind,
and glittered to the beam of night, He ſaw the
grief of Swaran, and ſpoke to the firſt of bards.

gers to mead. Several ancient poems mention wax lights and
wine as common in the halls of Fingal. The Caledonians in their
ſrequent incurſions to the province might become acquainted
with thoſe conveniencies of life, and introduce them into
their own country, among the booty which they carried from
South Britain.
