 <div><head>PREFACE.</head><p> <sc>Without</sc> encreaſing his genius, the Author may have improved his language, in the eleven years, that the following poems have been in the hands of the public, Errors in diction might have been committed at twenty-four, which the experience of a riper age may remove; and ſome exuberances in imagery may be reſtrained, with advantage, by a degree of judgment acquired in the progreſs of time. Impreſſed with this opinion, he ran over the whole with attention and accuracy ; and, he hopes, he has brought the work to a ſtate of correctneſs, which will preclude all future improvements.</p><p><sc>The</sc> eagerneſs, with which theſe Poems have been received abroad, are a recompence for the coldneſs with which a few have affected to treat them at home. All the polite nations of Europe have transferred them into their re<!--  -->

 ſpective languages; and they ſpeak of him, who brought them to light, in terms that might flatter the vanity of one fond of fame. In a convenient indifference for a literary reputation, the Author hears praiſe without being elevated, and ribaldry, without being depreſſed. He has frequently ſeen the firſt beſtowed too precipitately; and the latter is ſo faithleſs to its purpoſe, that it is often the only index to merit in the preſent age.</p><p><sc>Though</sc> the taſte, which defines genius, by the points of the compaſs, is a ſubject fit for mirth in itſelf, it is often a ſerious matter in the ſale of a work. When rivers define the limits of abilities, as well as the boundaries of countries, a Writer may meaſure his ſucceſs, by the latitude under which he was born. It was to avoid a part of this inconvenience, that the Author is ſaid, by ſome, who ſpeak without any authority, to have aſcribed his own productions to another name. If this was the caſe, he was but young in the art of deception. When he placed the poet in <!--  -->

 antiquity, the Tranſlator ſhould have been born on this ſide of the Tweed.</p><p><sc>These</sc> obſervations regard only the frivolous in matters of literature; theſe, however, form a majority in every age and nation. In this country, men of genuine taſte abound ; but their ſtill voice is drowned in the clamours of a multitude, who judge by faſhion of poetry, as of dreſs. The truth is, to judge aright requires almoſt as much genius as to write well; and good critics are as rare as great poets. Though two hundred thouſand Romans ſtood up, when Virgil came into the Theatre, Varius only could correCt the Æneid. He that obtains fame muſt receive it through mere faſhion; and gratify his vanity with the applauſe of men, of whoſe judgment he cannot approve.</p><p><sc>The</sc> following Poems, it muſt be confeſſed, are more calculated to pleaſe perſons of exquiſite feelings of heart, than thoſe who receive all their impreſſions by the ear.

 not deſtitute of harmony, will not to common readers ſupply the abſence of the frequent returns of rhime. This was the opinion of the Writer himſelf, tho' he yielded to the judgment of others, in a mode, which preſented freedom and dignity of expreſſion, inſtead of fetters, which cramp the thought, whilſt the harmony of language is preſerved. His intention was to publiſh in verſe. The making of poetry, like any other handicraft, may be learned by induſtry; and he had ſerved his apprenticeſhip, though in ſecret, to the muſes,</p><p><sc>It</sc> is, however, doubtful, whether the harmony which theſe poems might derive from rhime, even in much better hands than thoſe of the tranſlator, could atone for the ſimplicity and energy, which they would loſe. The determination of this point ſhall be left to the readers of this preface. The following is the beginning of a poem, tranſlated from the Norſe to the Gaëlic language ; and, from the latter, transferred into Engliſh. The verſe took little more time to the writer than the proſe; and even he himſelf is doubtful, (if he <!--  -->

The tempeſts roll dark on his Yides, but calm, above, his vaſt forehead appears, White-iſſuing from the ſkirt of his ſtorms, the troubled torrents pour down his ſides.

 with renown: When he conquered in that rude field, where Lulan's warriors fell in blood, or roſe, in terror, on the waves of the main. Darkly ſat the grey-haired chief; yet ſorrow dwelt not in his ſoul.

His ſon, in Lulan's battle ſlain, beheld not his father's flight from his foes. Nor finiſhed ſeemed the ancient line ! The ſplendid beauty of bright-eyed Fithon, covered ſtill the fallen king with renown. Her arm was white like Gormal's ſnow ; her boſom whiter than the foam of the main, when roll the waves beneath the wrath of the winds. Like two ſtars were her radiant eyes, like two ſtars that riſe on the deep, when dark tumult embroils the night. Pleaſant are their beams aloft, as ſtately they aſcend the ſkies, <!--  -->

 <sc>Nor</sc> Odin forgot, in aught, the maid. Her form ſcarce equalled her lofty mind. Awe moved around her ſtately ſteps. Heroes loved—but ſhrunk away in their fears. Yet midſt the pride of all her charms, her heart was ſoft, and her ſoul was kind. She ſaw the mournful with tearful eyes. Tranſient darkneſs aroſe in her breaſt. Her joy was in the chace. Fach morning, when doubtful light wandered dimly on Lulan's waves, ſhe rouzed the reſounding woods, to Gormal's head of ſnow. Nor moved the maid alone,  and pouring through the plain Hurry the troubled Torno to the main.</p><p><sc>Grey</sc>, on the bank, remote from human kind, By aged pines, half ſhelter'd from the wind, A homely manſion roſe, of antique form, For ages batter'd by the polar ſtorm.

 In that rude field, where Suecia's chieſs were ſlain, Or forced to wander o'er the Bothnic main. Dark was his life, yet undiſturb'd with woes, But when the memory of defeat aroſe His proud heart ſtruck his ſide ; he graſpt the ſpear, And wounded Harold in the vacant air.</p><p><sc>One</sc> daughter only, but of form divine, The laſt fair beam of the departing line, Remain'd of Sigurd's race. His warlike ſon Fell in the ſhock, which overturn'd the throne. Nor deſolate the houſe ! Fionia's charms Suſtain'd the glory, which they loſt in arms. White was her arm, as Sevo's lofty ſnow, Her boſom fairer, than the waves below, When heaving to the winds. Her radiant eyes Like two bright ſtars, exulting as they riſe, O'er the dark tumult of a ſtormy night And gladd'ning heav'n, with their majeſtic light,</p><p><sc>In</sc> nought is Odin to the maid unkind Her form ſcarce equals her exalted mind, Awe leads her ſacred ſteps where'er they move, And mankind worſhip, where they dare not love. But, mix'd with ſoftneſs, was the virgin's pride, Her heart had feelings, which her eyes deny'd. Her bright tears ſtarted at another's woes, While tranſient darkneſs on her ſoul aroſe.</p><p><sc>The</sc> chace ſhe lov'd; when morn, with doubtful beans Came dimly wandering o'er the Bothnic ſtream, On Sevo's ſounding ſides, ſhe bent the bow, And rouz'd his foreſts to his head of ſnow. Nor mov'd the maid alone; &amp;c. <!--  -->

<!-- PREFACE. xiii -->
</p><p><sc>One</sc> of the chief improvements, on this edition, is the care taken, in arranging the poems in the order of time; ſo as to form a kind of regular hiſtory of the age to which they relate. The writer has now reſigned them for ever to their fate. That they have been well received by the public, appears from an extenſive fale; that they ſhall continue to be well received, he may venture to prophecy without the gift of that inſpiration, to which poets lay claim. Through the medium of verſion upon verſion, they retain, in foreign languages, their native character of ſimplicity and energy. Genuine poetry, like gold, loſes little, when properly transfuſed ; but when a compoſition cannot bear the teſt of a literal verſion, it is a counterfeit which ought not to paſs current. The operation muſt, however, be performed with ſkilful hands. A tranſlator, who cannot equal his original, is incapable of expreſſing its beauties.</p><p><sc>London</sc>, Aug. 15, 1773 </p></div> <!--  -->
