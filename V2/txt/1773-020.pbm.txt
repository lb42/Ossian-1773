in the STRAND,

Bookſeller to their Royal Highneſſes the Prince of {Wales} and
Biſhop of {Osnaburgh},

FABLES de La FONTAINE,

Printed at Paris, in Four Volumes Folio.

This very magnificent Work is propoſed to the Publick at only {{Eight}}
Guineas in Sheets, being but Half the original Price.

This Edition, which coſt the Artiſts near twenty Years Labour,
and the Proprietors upwards of {{Fourteen thouſand Pounds Sterling}}, is
undoubtedly one of the moſt ſuperb Monuments ever erected to the
Memory of an Author.

It is printed with a new Letter, on a fine Paper, manufactured ex-
preſsly for the Work ; every Fable being ornamented by a Head and
Tail-piece, deſigned in a new Taſte, by M. {Bachelier}, and exe-
cuted by M. {T. Papillon} and {Le Sueur},

To the Beauty this Work derives from the Printing-preſs, is alſo
added the capital Embelliſhment of no leſs than {Two Hundred} and
{Seventy-six} Copper-plates; the Deſigns applicable to the Subjects,
drawn after Nature, by {Oudry}, one of the moſt celebrated Painters
France ever produced for delineating the Animal Creation. The En-
gravings by the moſt expert Artiſts in their ſeveral Departments, un-
der the Direction of the celebrated M. {Cochin} ; who reviſed and ſu-
perintended the Whole.

{La Fontaine}'s Life is prefixed, containing many Anecdotes of
that exquiſite Fabuliſt, not to be met with elſewhere.

* * * Such Ladies and Gentlemen who are deſirous of being poſ-
ſeſſed of this magnificent Work, are requeſted to ſavour the
Proprietors with their Commands.
