EPIC POEM.
BOOK I._
{The} blue waves of Erin roll in light. The
mountains are covered with day. Trees
ſhake their duſky heads, in the breeze. Grey
torrents pour their noiſy ſtreams. Two green
hills, with aged oaks, ſurround a narrow plain.
The blue courſe of a ſtream is there. On its
banks ſtood Cairbar @1 of Atha. His ſpear ſupports
the king : the red eye of his fear is ſad. Cor-
mac riſes in his ſoul, with all his ghaſtly wounds.

@1 Cairbar, the ſon of Borbar duthul, was deſcended lineally
from Lathon the chief of the Firbolg, the firſt colony who
ſettled in the ſouth of Ireland. The Cael were in poſſeſſion of
the northern coaſt of that kingdom, and the firſt monarchs
of Ireland were of their race. Hence aroſe thoſe differences
between the two nations, which terminated, at laſt, in the
murder of Cormac, and the uſurpation of Cairbar, lord of
Atha, who is mentioned in this place.
