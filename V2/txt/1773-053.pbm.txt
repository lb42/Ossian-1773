4 TE M O R A: Book I.
--
The grey form of the youth appears in darkneſs.
Blood pours from his airy ſide. Cairbar thrice
threw his ſpear on earth. Thrice he ſtroaked
his beard. His ſteps are ſhort. He often ſtops.
He toſſes his ſinewy arms. He is like a cloud in
the deſart, varying its form to every blaſt. The
valleys are ſad around, and fear, by turns, the
ſhower ! The king, at length, reſumed his ſoul.
He took his pointed ſpear, He turned his eye
to Moi-lena, The ſcouts of blue ocean came.
They came with ſteps of fear, and often looked
behind. Cairbar knew that the mighty were
near ! He called his gloomy chiefs.

{The} ſounding ſteps of his warriors came.
They drew, at once, their ſwords. There Mor-
lath @2 ſtood with darkened face. Hidalla's long
hair ſighs in wind. Red-haired Cormar bends
on his ſpear, and rolls his ſide-long-looking eyes.
Wild is the look of Malthos from beneath too
==
@2 M&oacute;r-lath,{{great in the day of battle}}, Hidalla, {{mildly look-
ing hero}}. Cor-mar, {{expert at ſea}}. Milth-os, {{ſlow to ſpeak}}.
Foldath, {{generous}}.

Foldath, who is here ſtrongly marked, makes a great figure
in the ſequel of the poem. His fierce, uncomplying character
is ſuſtained throughout. He ſeems, from a paſſage in the ſe-
cond book, to have been Cairbar's greateſt confident, and to
have had a principal hand in the conſpiracy againſt Cormac
king of Ireland. His tribe was one of the moſt conſiderable of
the race of the Fir-bolg.
