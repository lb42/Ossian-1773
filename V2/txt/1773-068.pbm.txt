brother is not here. He is not here with his
thouſands, and our arms are weak. Cathmor
is a foe to ſtrife at the feaſt! His ſoul is bright
as that ſun! But Cairbar muſt fight with Oſcar,
chiefs of woody Temora! His words for Cathol
were many : the wrath of Cairbar burns. He

@11 Cathmor, {{great in battle}}, the ſon of Borbar-duthul, and
brother of Cairbar king of Ireland, had, before the inſurrec-
tion of the Firbolg, paſſed over into Inis-huna, ſuppoſed to be
a part of South-Britain, to aſſiſt Conmor king of that place
againſt his enemies. Cathmor was ſucceſsful in the war, but,
in the courſe of it, Conmor was either killed, or died a na-
tural death. Cairbar, upon intelligence of the deſigns of
Fingal to dethrone him, had diſpatched a meſſenger for Cath-
mor, who returned into Ireland a few days before the opening
of the poem.

Cairbar here takes advantage of his brother's abſence, to
perpetrate his ungenerous deſigns againſt Oſcar ; for the noble
ſpirit of Cathmor, had he been preſent, would not have per-
mitted the laws of that hoſpitality, for which he was ſo re-
nowned himſelf, to be violated. The brothers form a con-
traſt : we do not deteſt the mean ſoul of Cairbar more, than
we admire the difintereſted and generous mind of Cathmor.
