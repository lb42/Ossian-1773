chiefs of Selma heard their joy @12. We thought
that mighty Cathmor came. Cathmor the friend
of ſtrangers! the brother of red-haired Cairbar.
Their ſouls were not the ſame. The light of
heaven was in the boſom of Cathmor. His
towers roſe on the banks of Atha : ſeven paths
led to his halls. Seven chiefs ſtood on the

@12 Fingal's army heard the joy that was in Cairbar's camp.
The character given of Cathmor is agreeable to the times.
Some, through oſtentation, were hoſpitable ; and others fell
naturally into a cuſtom handed down from their anceſtors.
But what marks ſtrongly the character of Cathmor, is his
averſion to praiſe ; for he is repreſented to dwell in a wood to
avoid the thanks of his gueſts; which is ſtill a higher degree
of generoſity than that of Axylus in Homer : for the poet does
not ſay, but the good man might, at the head of his own
table, have heard with pleaſure the praiſe beſtowed on him by
the people he entertained.

No nation in the world carried hoſpitality to a greater
length than the ancient Scots. it was even infamous, for
many ages, in a man of condition, to have the door of his
Houſe ſhut at all, {lest}, as the bards expreſs it, {the stran-
ger should come and behold his contracted soul},
Some of the chiefs were poſſeſſed of this hoſpitable diſpoſition
to an extravagant degree ; and the bards, perhaps upon a pri-
vate account, never failed to recommend it, in their eulo-
giums. ``{{Cean uia' na dai}}”, or {{the point to which all the roads
of the ſtrangers lead}}, was an invariable epithet given by them
to the chiefs; on the contrary, they diſtinguiſhed the inhoſ-
pitable by the title of {{the cloud which the ſtrangers ſhun}}. This
laſt however was ſo uncommon, that in all the old poems I
have ever met with, I found but one man branded with this
ignominious appellation; and that, perhaps, only founded
upon a private quarrel, which ſubſiſted between him and the
patron of the bard, who wrote the poem,
