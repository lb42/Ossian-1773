12 T E M O R A: Book 1.

Cairbar, ``I behold the ſpear @14 of Erin. The
ſpear of Temora @15 glitters in thy hand, ſon of
woody Morven! It was the pride of an hun-
dred @15 kings. The death of heroes of old.
Yield it, ſon of Oſſian, yield it to car-borne
Cairbar !”

`` {Shall} I yield,” Oſcar replied, ``the gift
of Erin's injured king: the gift of fair-haired
Cormac, when Oſcar ſcattered his foes? I came
to Cormac's halls of joy, when Swaran fled from
Fingal. Gladneſs roſe in the face of youth.
He gave the ſpear of Temora. Nor did he give
it to the feeble : neither to the weak in ſoul.
The darkneſs of thy face is no ſtorm to me: nor
are thine eyes the flame of death. Do I fear thy
clanging ſhield? Tremble I at Olla's ſong ?
No : Cairbar, frighten the feeble : Oſcar is a
rock!"

@14 Cormac, the ſon of Arth, had given the ſpear, which is
here the ſoundation of the quarrel, to Oſcar when he came to
congratulate him, upon Swaran's being expelled from Ire-
land.
@15 Ti' m&oacute;r-i', {{the houſe of the great king}}, the name of the
royal palace of the ſupreme kings of Ireland.
@16 {{Hundred}} here is an indefinite number, and is only in-
tended to expreſs a great many. It was probably the hyper-
bolical phraſes of bards, that gave the firſt hint to the Iriſh
Senachies to place the origin of their monarchy in ſo remote
a period as they have done.
