Book I. An EPIC POEM. 13
--

`` {Wilt} thou not yield the ſpear ?” replied
the rifing pride of Cairbar. `` Are thy words ſo
mighty, becauſe Fingal is near ? Fingal with
aged locks, from Morven's hundred groves !
He has fought with little men. But he muſt
vaniſh before Cairbar, like a thin pillar of miſt
before the winds of Atha @16!” ``Were he who
fought with little men, near Atha's haughty
chief: Atha's chief would yield green Erin to
avoid his rage ! Speak not of the mighty, O
Cairbar! Turn thy ſword on me. Our ſtrength
is equal : but Fingal is renowned ! the firſt of
mortal men!”

{Their} people ſaw the darkening chiefs. Their
crowding ſteps are heard around. Their eyes
roll in fire. A thouſand ſwords are half un-
ſheathed. Red-haired Olla raiſed the ſong of
battle. The trembling joy of Oſcar's ſoul aroſe :
the wonted joy of his ſoul when Fingal's horn
was heard. Dark as the ſwelling wave of ocean
before the rifing winds, when it bends its head
near the coaſt, came on the hoſt of Cairbar !

{Daughter} of Toſcar@17 ! why that tear? He
is not fallen yet. Many were the deaths of his
arm before my hero fell !
