Book I. An EPIC POEM. 15
--
vided his red hair behind. He lay, like a
ſhattered rock, which Cromla ſhakes from its
ſhaggy ſide; when the green-vallied Erin ſhakes
its mountains, from ſea to ſea!

{But} never more ſhall Oſcar riſe! He leans on
his boſſy ſhield. His ſpear is in his terrible
hand. Brin's ſons ſtand diſtant and dark. Their
ſhouts ariſe, like crouded ſtreams, Moi-lena
ecchoes wide. Fingal heard the ſound. He
took the ſpear of Selma. His ſteps are before
us on the heath. He ſpoke the words of woe.

\Briathar buan ſin ; Briathar buan
\A bheireadh an Cairbre rua',
\Gu tuga' ſe ſealg, agus creach
\A {h'Albin} an la'r na mhaireach.

Oſcar replied, that, the next day, he himſelf would carry
into Albion the ſpoils of the five provinces of Ireland; in
ſpite of the oppoſition of Cairbar.

\Briathar eile an aghai' fin
\A bheirea' an t' Oſcar, og, calma
\Gu'n tugadh ſe fealg agus creach
\Do dh' {Albin} an la'r na mhaireach, &amp;c,

Oſcar, in conſequence of his threats, began to lay waſte Ire-
land ; but as he returned with the ſpoil into Ulſter, thro' the
narrow paſs of Gabhra {{Caorl ghlen Ghabhra}} he was met, by
Cairbar, and a battle enſued, in which both the heroes fell
by mutual wounds. The bard gives a very curious liſt of the
followers of Oſcar, as they marched to battle. They appear
to have been five hundred in number, commanded, as the
poet expreſſes it, by {{five heroes of the blood of kings}} This
poem mentions Fingal, as arriving from Scotland. before
Oſcar died of his wounds.
