Book I. An EPIC POEM. I9

day of our fall. Then let us be renowned when
we may ; and leave our fame behind us, like the
laſt beams of the ſun, when he hides his red
head in the weſt. The traveller mourns his
abſence, thinking of the flame of his beams.
Ullin my aged bard! take thou the ſhip of the
king. Carry Oſcar to Selma of harps. Let the
daughters of Morven weep. We muſt fight in
Erin, for the race of fallen Cormac. The days
of my years begin to fail. I feel the weakneſs of
my arm. My fathers bend from their clouds,
to receive their grey-hair'd ſon. But, before I
go hence, one beam of fame ſhall rife. My
days ſhall end, as my years begun, in fame.
My life ſhall be one ſtream of light to bards of
other times!”

{Ullin} rais'd his white ſails. The wind of
the ſouth came forth. He bounded on the waves
toward Selma. I remained in my grief, but
my words were not heard. The feaſt is ſpread
on Moi-lena. An hundred heroes reared the
tomb of Cairbar. No ſong is raiſed over the
chief. His ſoul had been dark and bloody. The
bards remembered the fall of Cormac ! what
could they ſay in Cairbar's praiſe ?

{Night} came rolling down. The light of an
hundred oaks aroſe, Fingal ſat beneath a tree.
