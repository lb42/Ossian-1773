the ground. They had forgot the war, for he,
their fire, was ſeen no more |

``{But} who,” ſaid the ſoft-voiced Carril,
`` who come like bounding roes? Their ſtature
is like young trees in the valley, growing in a
ſhower ! Soft and ruddy are their cheeks ! Fear-
leſs ſouls look forth from their eyes! Who but
the ſons of Uſnoth @28, chief of ſtreamy Etha ?
The people riſe on every ſide, like the ſtrength
of an half-extinguiſhed fire, when the winds
come, ſudden, from the deſart, on their ruſtling
wings. Sudden glows the dark brow of the
hill; the paſſing mariner lags, on his winds.
The ſound of Caithbat's @29 ſhield was heard.

@28 Uſnoth chief of Etha, a diſtrict on the weſtern coaſt of
Scotland, had three ſons, Nathos, Althos, and Ardan, by Slis-
ſama the ſiſter of Cuthullin. The three brothers, when very
young, were ſent over to Ireland by their father, to learn the
uſe of arms under their uncle, whoſe military fame was very
great in that kingdom. They had juſt arrived in Ulſter when
the news of Cuthullin's death arrived. Nathos, the eldeſt of
the three brothers, took the command of Cuthullin's army,
and made head againſt Cairbar the chief of Atha. Cairbar
having, at laſt, murdered young king Cormac, at Temora,
the army of Nathos ſhifted ſides, and the brothers were obliged
to return into Ulſter, in order to paſs over into Scotland. The
ſequel of their mournful ſtory is related, at large, in the poem
of Dar-thula.
@29 Caithbait was grandfather to Cuthullin; and his ſhield
was made uſe of to alarm his poſterity to the battles of the
family.
