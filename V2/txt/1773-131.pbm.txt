_ARGUMENT to Book II._
This book opens, we may ſuppoſe, about midnight, with a ſo-
liloquy of Oſſian, who had retired, from the reſt of the army,
to mourn for his ſon Oſcar. Upon hearing the noiſe of
Cathmor's army approaching, he went to find out his bro-
ther Fillan, who kept the watch, on the hill of Mora, in
the front of Fingal's arm., In the converſation of the bro-
thers, the epiſode of Conar, the ſon of Trenmor, who was
the firſt king of Ireland, is introduced, which lays open the
origin of the conteſts between the Cael and Firbolg, the two
nations who firſt poſſeſſed themſelves of that iſland. Ofſian
kindles a fire on Mora ; upon which Cathmor deſiſted from
the deſign he had formed of ſurpriſing the army of the Ca-
ledonians. He calls a council of his chiefs; reprimands
Foldath for adviſing a night-attack, as the Iriſh army were
ſo much ſuperior in number to the enemy. The bard Fonar
introduces the ſtory of Crothar, the anceſtor of the king,
which throws further light on the hiſtory of Ireland, and the
original pretenſions of the family of Atha, to the throne of
that kingdom. The Iriſh chiefs lie down to reſt, and Cath-
mor himſelf undertakes the watch. In his circuit, round
the army, he is met by Oſſian, The interview of the two
heroes is deſcribed, Cathmor obtains a promiſe from Oſſian,
to order a funeral elegy to be ſung over the grave of Cair-
bar; it being the opinion of the times, that the ſouls of the
dead could not be happy, till their elegies were ſung by a
bard. Morning comes. Cathmor and Oſſian part; and
the latter, caſually meeting with Carril the ſon of Kinſena,
ſends that bard, with a funeral ſong, to the tomb of Cairbar.
