_T E M O R A:
AN
EPIC POEM.
BOOK II._

@1{Father} of heroes! O Trenmor ! High
dweller of eddying winds! where the dark--
red thunder marks the troubled clouds ! Open
thou thy ſtormy halls. Let the bards of old be
near. Let them draw near, with ſongs and their
half-viewleſs harps. No dweller of miſty valley
comes ! No hunter unknown at his ſtreams ! It
is the carborne Oſcar, from the fields of war.
==
@1 Though this book has little action, it is not the leaſt im-
portant part of Temora. The poet, in ſeveral epiſodes, runs
up the cauſe of the war to the very ſource. The firſt popula-
tion of Ireland, the wars between the two nations who origi-
nally poſſeſſed that iſland, its firſt race of kings, and the revo-
lutions of its government, are important facts, and are delivered
by the poet, with ſo little mixture of the fabulous, that one
cannot help preferring his accounts to the improbable fictions
of the Scotch and Iriſh hiftorians. The Mileſian fables bear
about them the marks of a late invention. To trace their le-
gends to their ſource would be no difficult taſk ; but a diſ-
quiſition of this ſort would extend this note too far.
