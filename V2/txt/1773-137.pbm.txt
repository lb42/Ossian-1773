32 T E M O R A: Book II.
--
Sudden is thy change, my ſon, from what thou
wert on dark Moilena! The blaft folds thee
in its ſkirt, and ruffles through the ſky ! Doſt
thou not behold thy father, at the ſtream of
night? The chiefs of Morven ſleep far-diſtant.
They have loſt no ſon : But ye have loſt a hero,
chiefs of reſounding Morven! Who could equal
his ſtrength, when battle rolled againſt his ſide,
like the darkneſs of crowded waters? Why this
cloud on Oſſian's ſoul ? It ought to burn in dan-
ger. Erin is near with her hoſt. The king of
Selma is alone. Alone thou ſhalt not be, my
father, while I can lift the ſpear !

{I rose}, in all my arms. I roſe and liſten-

@2 We underſtand, from the preceding book, that Cathmor
was near with an army. When Cairbar was killed, the tribes
who attended him fell back to Cathmor; who, as it afterwards
appears, had taken a reſolution to ſurprize Fingal by night.
Fillan was diſpatched to the hill of Mora, which was in the
front of the Caledonians, to obſerve the motions of Cathmor.
In this ſituation were affairs when Oſſian, upon hearing the
noiſe of the approaching enemy, went to find out his brother.
Their converſation naturally introduces the epiſode, concern-
ing Conar the ſon of Trenmor, the firſt Iriſh monarch, which
is ſo neceſſary to the underſtanding the foundation of the rebel-
lion and uſurpation of Cairbar and Cathmor. Fillan was the
youngeſt of the ſons of Fingal, then living. He and Boſmina,
mentioned in the {{battle of Lora}}, were the only children of the
king, by Clatho the daughter of Cathulla king of Inis-tore,
whom he had taken to wife, after the death of Ros-crana, the
daughter of Cormac Mac-Conar king of Ireland.
