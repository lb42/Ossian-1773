Book II, An EPIC POEM. 35

away. Sadneſs ought not to dwell in danger,
nor the tear in the eye of war. Our fathers for-
got their fallen ſons, till the noiſe of arms was
paſt. Then ſorrow returned to the tomb, and
the ſong of bards aroſe.” The memory of thoſe,
who fell, quickly followed the departure of
war: When the tumult of battle is paſt, the ſoul,
in ſilence, melts away, for the dead.

{Conar}@6 was the brother of Trathal, firſt of
mortal men. His battles were on every coaſt. A

tereſting, that others, foreign to the ſubject, could not be in-
troduced with any luſtre. Though the epiſode, which follows,
may ſeem to flow naturally enough from the converſation of the
brothers, yet I have ſhewn, in a preceding note, and, more at
large, in the diſſertation annexed to this collection, that the
poet had a farther deſign in view.
@6 Conar, the firſt king of Ireland, was the ſon of Trenmor,
the great-grand-father of Fingal. It was on account of this
family-connection, that Fingal was engaged in ſo many wars in
the cauſe of the race of Conar. Tho' few of the actions of Tren-
mor are mentioned, he was the moſt renowned name of antiquity.
The moſt probable opinion concerning him is, that he was the
firſt, who united the tribes of the Caledonians, and commanded
them, in chief, againſt the incurſions of the Romans. The ge-
nealogiſts of the North have traced his family far back, and
given a liſt of his anceſtors to {{Cuan-m&oacute;r nan lan}}, or Conmor of
the ſwords, who, according to them, was the firſt who croſſed
the {{great ſea}}, to Caledonia, from which circumſtance his name
proceeded, which ſignifies {{Great ocean}}. Genealogies of ſo an-
cient a date, however, are little to be depended upon.
