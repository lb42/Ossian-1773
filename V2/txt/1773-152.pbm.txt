Book II. Av EPIC POEM. 37
--
alone, Colgar @7 was at his ſide; Colgar the
ſon of the King and of white-boſomed Solin-
colma.

{As} Trenmor, cloathed with meteors, deſcends
from the halls of thunder, pouring the dark
ſtorm before him over the troubled ſea ; ſo Col-
gar deſcended to battle, and waſted the ecchoing
field. His father rejoiced over the hero : but an
arrow came! His tomb was raiſed, without a
tear. The King was to revenge his ſon. He
lightened forward in battle, till Bolga yielded at
her ſtreams !

{When} peace returned to the land : When
his blue waves bore the king to Morven : then
he remembered his ſon, and poured the ſilent
tear. Thrice did the bards, at the cave of Fur-
mono, call the ſoul of Colgar. They called him
to the hills of his land. He heard them in his
miſt, Trathal placed his ſword in the cave, that
the ſpirit of his ſon might rejoice.

Colgar was the eldeſt of the ſons of Trathal: Comhal, who
was the father of Fingal, was very young when the preſent ex-
pedition to Ireland happened, It is remarkable, that, of all
the anceſtors of Fingal, tradition makes the leaſt mention of
Comhal ; which, probably, proceeded from the unfortunate
life and untimely death of that hero. From ſome paſſages,
concerning him, we learn, indeed, that he was brave, but
he wanted conduct.
