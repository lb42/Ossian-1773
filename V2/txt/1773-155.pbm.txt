38 TE M O R A: Book II.
--
``{Colgar} @8, ſon of Trathal!” ſaid Fillan,
`` thou wert renowned in youth! But the king
hath not marked my ſword, bright-ſtreaming on
the field. I go forth with the crowd. I return,
without my fame. But the foe approaches,
Oſſian ! I hear their murmur on the heath. The
ſound of their ſteps is like thunder, in the boſom
of the ground, when the rocking hills ſhake their
groves, and not a blaſt pours from the darkened
ſky !”

{Ossian} turned ſudden on his ſpear. He
raiſed the flame of an oak on high. I ſpread it
large, on Mora's wind. Cathmor ſtopt in his
courſe. Gleaming he ſtood, like a rock, on
whoſe ſides are the wandering of blaſts; which
ſeize its ecchoing ſtreams and clothe them over
with ice. So ſtood the friend @9 of ſtrangers !
The winds lift his heavy locks. Thou art the
talleſt of the race of Erin, king of ſtreamy Atha !

@8 The poem begins here to mark ſtrongly the character of
Fillan, who is to make ſo great a figure in the ſequel.
He has the impatience, the ambition and fire which are
peculiar to a young hero. Kindled with the fame of Col-
gar, he forgets his untimely fall. From Fillan's expreſſions
in this paſſage, it would ſeem, that he was neglected by Fin-
gal, on account of his youth.
@9 Cathmor is diſtinguiſhed, by this honourable title, on ac-
count of his generoſity to ſtrangers, which was ſo great as to
be remarkable even in thoſe days of hoſpitality.
