Book II. An EPIC POEM. 39
--
``{First} of bards,” ſaid Cathmor, ``Fonar@10,
call the chiefs of Erin. Call red-hair'd Cormar :
dark-browed Malthos: the ſide-long-looking
gloom of Maronan. Let the pride of Foldath ap-
pear. The red-rolling eye of Turlotho. Nor let
Hidalla be forgot ; his voice, in danger, is the
ſound of a ſhower, when it falls in the blaſted
vale, near Atha's falling ſtream.” Pleaſant is
its ſound, on the plain, whilſt broken thunder
travels over the ſky !”

{They} came, in their clanging arms. They
bent forward to his voice, as if a fpirit of their
fathers ſpoke from a cloud of night. Dreadful
ſhone they to the light; like the fall of the
ſtream of Brumo@11, when the meteor lights it,
before the nightly ſtranger. Shuddering, he
ſtops in his journey, and looks up for the beam
of the morn !

@10 {{F&oacute;nar, the man of ſong}}. Before the introduction of Chriſ-
tianity a name was not impoſed upon any perſon, till he had
diſtinguiſhed himſelf by ſome remarkable action, from which
his name ſhould be derived. 
@11 Brumo was a place of worſhip (Fing. b. 6.) in Craca,
which is ſuppoſed to be one of the iſles of Shetland. It was
thought, that the ſpirits of the deceaſed haunted it, by night,
which adds more terror to the deſcription introduced here.
{{The horrid circle of Brumo, where often, they ſaid, the ghoſts of
the dead howled round the ſtone of fear}}.
