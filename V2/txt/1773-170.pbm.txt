``{He} purſued the chace in Ullin : on the
moſs covered top of Drumardo. From the
wood looked the daughter of Cathmin, the

we find mention made of the towers of Atha in the time of
Cathmor, which could not well be applied to wooden build-
ings. In Caledonia they begun very early to build with ſtone.
None of the houſes of Fingal, excepting Ti-foirmal, were of
wood. Ti-foirmal was the great hall where the bards met to re-
peat their compoſitions annually, before they ſubmitted them
to the judgment of the king in Selma. By ſome accident or
other, this wooden houſe happened to be burnt, and an ancient
bard, in the character of Oſſian, has left us a curious catalogue
of the furniture which it contained, The poem is not juſt
now in my hands, otherwiſe I would lay here a tranſlation of
it before the reader. It has little poetical merit, and evidently
bears the marks of a later period.
@18 Alnecma, or Alnecmacht, was the ancient name of Con-
naught. Ullin is ſtill the Iriſh name of the province of Ulſter.
To avoid the multiplying of notes, I ſhall here give the ſigni-
fication of the names in this epiſode. Drumardo, {{high ridge}},
Cathmin, {{calm in battle}} C&oacute;n-lamha, {{ſoft hand}}, Turloch,
{{man of the quiver}}. Cormul, {{blue eye}}.
