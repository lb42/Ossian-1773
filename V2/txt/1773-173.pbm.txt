`` {Three} days feaſted Crothar with Cath-
min. On the fourth they awaked the hinds.
Con-lama moved to the chace, with all her
lovely ſteps. She met Crothar in the narrow
path. The bow fell, at once, from her hand.
She turned her face away, and half-hid it with
her locks. The love of Crothar roſe. He
brought the white-boſomed maid to Atha. Bards
raiſed the ſong in her preſence. Joy dwelt
round the daughter of Cathmin.”

{The} pride of Turloch roſe, a youth who loved
the white-handed Con-l&aacute;ma. He came, with battle,
to Alnecma; to Atha of the roes. Cormul went
forth to the ſtrife, the brother of car-borne Cro-
thar. He went forth, but he fell. The ſigh of
his people roſe. Silent and tall, acroſs the
ſtream, came the darkening ſtrength of Crothar :
he rolled the foe from Alnecoma. He returned,
mid the joy of Con-lama.”

``{Battle} on battle comes. Blood is poured
on blood. The tombs of the valiant riſe. Erin's
clouds are hung round with ghoſts. The chiefs
of the ſouth gathered round the ecchoing ſhield
of Crothar. He came, with death, to the paths
of the foe. The virgins wept, by the ſtreams
of Ullin. They looked to the miſt of the hill ;
No hunter deſcended from its folds. Silence
