Book I. An EPIC POEM. 45
--
darkened in the land. Blaſts ſighed lonely on
graſſy tombs.”

``{Descending} like the eagle of heaven, with
all his ruſtling wings, when he forſakes the
blaſt, with joy, the ſon of Trenmor came; Co-
nar, arm of death, from Morven of the groves.
He poured his might along green Erin. Death
dimly ſtrode behind his ſword. The ſons of
Bolga fled, from his courſe, as from a ſtream,
that burſting from the ſtormy deſart, rolls the
fields together, with all their ecchoing woods.
Crothar @19 met him in battle: but Alnecma's
warriors fled. The king of Atha ſlowly retired,
in the grief of his ſoul. He, afterwards, ſhone

@19 The delicacy here, with regard to Crothar, is proper.
As he was the anceſtor of Cathmor, to whom the epiſode
is addreſſed, the bard ſoftens his defeat, by only mention-
ing that his people fled. Cathmor took the ſong of Fonar
in an unfavourable light. The bards, being of the order of
the Druids, who pretended to a foreknowlege of events, were
ſuppoſed to have ſome ſupernatural preſcience of futurity.
The king thought, that the choice of Fonar's ſong proceeded,
from his foreſeeing the unfortunate iſſue of the war ; and that-
his own fate was ſhadowed out, in that of his anceſtor Cro-
thar. The attitude of the bard, after the reprimand of his
patron, is pictureſque and affecting, We admire the ſpeech of
Cathmor, but lament the effect it has on the feeling ſoul of
the good old poet.
