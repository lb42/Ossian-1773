Book II. An EPIC POEM. 51
--
Roll on, thou careleſs light. Thou too, per-
haps, muſt fall, Thy darkening hour may
ſeize thee, ſtruggling, as thou rolleſt through
thy ſky. But pleaſant is the voice of the bard:
pleaſant to Oſſian's ſoul! It is like the ſhower
of the morning, when it comes through the
ruſtling vale, on which the ſun looks thro miſt,
juſt riſing from his rocks. But this is no time,
O bard, to ſit down, at the ſtrife of ſong. Fin-
gal is in arms on the vale. Thou ſeeft the
flaming ſhield of the king. His face darkens
between his locks. He beholds the wide rolling
of Erin. Does not Carril behold that tomb,
beſide the roaring ſtream ? Three ſtones lift
their grey heads, beneath a bending oak. A king
is lowly laid ! Give thou his ſoul to the wind.
He is the brother of Cathmor ! Open his airy
hall! Let thy ſong be a ſtream of joy to Cair-
bar's darkened ghoſt.”
