_ARGUMENT to Book III._
{Morning} coming on, Fingal, after a ſpeech to his people,
devolves the command on Gaul, the ſon of Morni ; it being
the cuſtom of the times, that the king ſhould not engage,
till the neceſſity of affairs required his ſuperior valour and
conduct. The king and Oſſian retire to the rock of Cor-
mul, which overlooked the field of battle. The bards ſing
the war-ſong. The general conflict is deſcribed. Gaul,
the ſon of Morni, diſtinguiſhes himſelf ; kills Tur-lathon,
chief of Moruth, and other chiefs of lefſer name. On the
other hand, Foldath, who commanded the Iriſh army (for
Cathmor, after the example of Fingal, kept himſelf from
battle) fights gallantly ; kills Connal, chief of Dun-lora,
and advances to engage Gaul himſelf. Gaul, in the mean
time, being wounded in the hand, by a random arrow, is
covered by Fillan, the ſon of Fingal, who performs prodi-
gies of valour. Night comes on. The horn of Fingal
recalls his army. The bards meet them, with a congra-
tulatory ſong, in which the praiſes of Gaul and Fillan are
particularly celebrated. The chiefs fit down at a feaſt;
Fingal miſſes Connal. The epiſode of Connal and Duth-
caron is introduced ; which throws further light on the
ancient hiſtory of Ireland. Carril is diſpatched to raiſe the
tomb of Connal. The action of this book takes up the
ſecond day, from the opening of the poem.
