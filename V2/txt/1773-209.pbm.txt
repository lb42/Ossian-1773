when {he} is feeble, that the ſighs of Fingal are
heard : left death ſhould come, without renown,
and darkneſs dwell on his tomb. Who ſhall
lead the war, againſt the hoſt of Alnecma ? It is,
only when danger grows, that my ſword ſhall
ſhine. Such was the cuſtom, heretofore, of
Trenmor the ruler of winds! and thus deſcended
to battle the blue-ſhielded Trathal !”

{The} Chiefs bend toward the king. Each
darkly ſeems to claim the war. They tell, by
halves, their mighty deeds. They turn their
eyes on Erin. But far before the reſt the ſon of
Morni ſtands. Silent he ſtands, for who had
not heard of the battles of Gaul? They roſe
within his ſoul. His hand, in ſecret, ſeized the
ſword. The ſword which he brought from
Strumon, when the ſtrength of Morni failed @1.

@1 Strumon, {{ſtream of the hill}}, the name of the ſeat of the
family of Gaul, in the neighbourhood of Selma. During
Gaul's expedition to Tromathon, mentioned in the {{poem of
Oithona}}, Morni his father died. Morni ordered the {{ſword of
Strumon}}, (which had been preſerved, in the family, as a re-
lique, from the days of Colgach, the moſt renowned of his
anceftors) to be laid by his ſide, in the tomb: at the ſame
time, leaving it in charge to his ſon, not to take it from
thence, till he was reduced to the laſt extremity. Not long
after, two of his brothers being ſlain, in battle, by Colda-
ronnan, Chief of Clutha, Gaul went to his father's tomb to
take the ſword. His addreſs to the ſpirit of the deceaſed hero,
is the ſubject of the following ſhort poem.
