``Breaker of ecchoing ſhields, whoſe head is deep in
ſhades; hear me from the darkneſs of Clora, O ſon of Col-
gach, hear!

No ruſtling, like the eagle's wing, comes over the courſe of
my ſtreams. Deep boſomed in the midſt of the deſart, O king
of Strumon, hear!

Dweleſt thou in the ſhadowy breeze, that pours its dark
wave over the graſs? Ceaſe to ſtrew the beard of the thiſtle ;
O chief of Clora, hear!

Or rideſt thou on a beam, amidſt the dark trouble of
clouds ? Poureſt thou the loud wind on ſeas, to roll their blue
waves over iſles ? hear me, father of Gaul; amidſt thy ter-
rors, hear!

The ruſtling of eagles is heard, the murmuring oaks ſhake
their heads on the hills : dreadful and pleaſant is thy approach,
friend of the dwelling of heroes.
%{Morni}.
Who awakes me, in the midſt of my cloud, where my locks
of miſt ſpread on the winds? Mixed with the noiſe of ſtreams,
why riſes the voice of Gaul ?
%{Gaul}.
My foes are around me, Morni: their dark ſhips deſcend
from their waves. Give the ſword of Stramon, that beam
which thou hideſt in thy night.
%{Morni}.
Take the ſword of reſounding Stramon ; I look on thy war,
my ſon ; I look, a dim meteor, from my cloud : blue-ſhielded
Gaul, deſtroy.”
