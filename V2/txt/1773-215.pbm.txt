My brother could not boaſt of battles: at once
he ſtrides away. Bent over a diſtant ſtream he

at times, the thiſtle's head, with his inverted
ſpear. Nor is he unſeen of Fingal. Sidelong

Clatho, to diſtinguiſh him from thoſe ſons which Fingal had
by Ros-cr&aacute;na.
@3 Ullin being ſent to Morven with the body of Oſcar, Oſſian
attends his father, in quality of chief bard.
