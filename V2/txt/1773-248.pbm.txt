them, the chief of blue-ſtreaming Atha. The
battle was mixed on the plain. Cormac @16 ſhone
in his own ſtrife, bright as the forms of his fa-
thers. But, far before the reſt, Duthcaron
hewed down the foe. Nor ſlept the arm of Con-
nal, by his father's ſide. Colc-ulla prevailed on
the plain : like ſcattered miſt, fled the people of
Cormac@17.”

@16 Cormac, the ſon of Conar, the ſecond king of Ireland, of
the race of the Caledonians. This inſurrecton of the Firbolg
happened towards the latter end of the long reign of Cormac.
He never poſſeſſed the Iriſh throne peaceably. The party of
the family of Atha had made ſeveral attempts to overturn the
ſucceſſion in the race of Conar, before they effected it, in the
minority of Cormac, the ſon of Artho. Ireland, from the
moſt ancient accounts concerning it, ſeems to have been al-
ways ſo diſturbed by domeſtic commotions, that it is difficult
to ſay, whether it ever was, for any length of time, ſubject to
one monarch. It is certain, that every province, if not every
ſmall diſtrict, had its own king. One of theſe petty princes
aſſumed, at times, the title of king of Ireland, and, on ac-
count of his ſuperior force, or in caſes of public danger, was
acknowledged by the reſt as ſuch ; but the ſucceſſion, from fa-
ther to ſon, does not appear to have been eſtabliſhed. It was
the diviſions amongſt themſelves, ariſing from the bad conſti-
tution of their government, that, at laſt, ſubjected the Iriſh to
a foreign yoke.
@17 The inhabitants of Ullin or Ulſter, who were of the race
of the Caledonians, ſeem, alone, to have been the firm friends
to the ſucceſſion in the family of Conar. The Firbolg were
only ſubject to them by conſtraint, and embraced every oppor
tunity to throw off their yoke.
