received his fame, and brightened, as he roſe on

%{Ros-crana}.
By night, came a dream to Ros cr&aacute;na! I feel my beating
ſoul. No viſion of the forms of the dead, came to the blue
eyes of Erin. But, riſing from the wave of the north, I be-
held him bright in his locks. I beheld the ſon of the king.
My beating ſoul is high. I laid my head down in night; again
aſcended the form, Why delayeſt thou thy coming, young rider
of ſtormy waves!

But, there, far-diſtant, he comes; where ſeas roll their
green ridges in miſt! Young dweller of my ſoul; why doſt
thou delay—
%{Fingal}.
It was the ſoft voice of Moi-lena ! the pleaſant breeze of the
valley of roes ! But why doſt thou hide thee in ſhades ? Young
love of heroes riſe. Are not thy ſteps covered with light? In
thy groves thou appeareſt, Ros-crana, like the ſun in the ga-
thering of clouds. Why doſt thou hide thee in ſhades? Young
love of heroes riſe.
%{Ros-crana}.
My fluttering ſoul is high! Let me turn from the ſteps of
the king, He has heard my ſecret voice, and ſhall my blue
eyes roll, in his preſence ? Roe of the hill of moſs, toward thy
dwelling I move. Meet me, ye breezes of Mora, as I move
through the valley of winds. But why ſhould he aſcend his
ocean ? Son of heroes, my ſoul is thine! My ſteps ſhall not
move to the deſart : the light of Ros-cr&aacute;na is here,
%{Fingal}.
It was the light tread of a ghoſt, the fair dweller of eddying
winds. Why deceiveſt thou me, with thy voice ? Here let
me reſt in ſhades. Shouldſt thou ſtretch thy white arm, from
thy grove, thou ſun-beam of Cormac of Erin !
%{Ros-crana}.
He is gone! and my blue-eyes are dim; faint-rolling, in
all my tears, But, there, I behold him, alone; king of Sel-
ma, my ſoul is thine. Ah me! what clanging of armour!
Colc-ulla of Atha is near!
