_ARGUMENT to Book IV._
{The} ſecond night continues. Fingal relates, at the feaſt, his
own firſt expedition into Ireland, and his marriage with
Ros-cr&aacute;na, the daughter of Cormac, king of that iſland.
The Iriſh chiefs convene in the preſence of Cathmor. The
ſituation of the king deſcribed. The ſtory of Sul-mala, the
daughter of Conmor, king of Inis-huna, who, in the diſ-
guiſe of a young warrior, had followed Cathmor to the war.
The ſullen behaviour of Foldath, who had commanded in
the battle of the preceding day, renews the difference be-
tween him and Malthos; but Cathmor, interpoſing, ends
it. The chiefs feaſt, and hear the ſong of Fonar the bard.
Cathmor returns to reſt, at a diſtance from the army. The
ghoſt of his brother Cairbar appears to him in a dream; and
obſcurely foretels the iſſue of the war. The ſoliloquy of the
king. He diſcovers Sul-malla. Morning comes. Her
ſoliloquy cloſes the book.
