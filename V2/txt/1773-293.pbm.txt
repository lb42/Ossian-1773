danger of Cairbar. Cathmor raiſed the ſail at
Cluba : but the winds were in other lands.
Three days he remained on the coaft, and turned
his eyes on Conmor's halls, He remembered
the daughter of ſtrangers, and his ſigh aroſe.

Cairbar, and the aſſaſſination of Cormac, king of Ireland,

@10 The ceremony which was uſed by Fingal, when he
prepared for an expedition, is related thus in tradition.
A bard, at midnight, went to the hall, where the tribes
feaſted upon ſolemn occaſions, raiſed the {{war-ſong}}, and thrice
called the ſpirits of their deceaſed anceſtors to come, {{on their
clouds}}, to behold the actions of their children. He then fixed
the {{ſhield of Trenmor}}, on a tree on the rock of Selma, ſtriking
it, at times, with the blunt end ofa ſpear, and ſinging the war-
ſong between. Thus he did, for three ſucceſſive nights, and,
in the mean time, meſſengers were diſpatched to call together
the tribes; or, to uſe an ancient expreſſion, {{to call them from
all their ſtreams}}. This phraſe alludes to the ſituation of the
reſidences of the clans, which were generally fixed in valleys,
where the torrents of the neighbouring mountains were col-
leted into one body, and became {{large ſtreams}} or rivers. {{The
lifting up of the ſhield}}, was the phraſe for beginning a war.
