ſun riſes, between them, on his glittering rocks.
Dark is their rolling on either ſide; each to-

{Silent} ſat the chiefs at the feaſt. They look,
at times, on Atha's king, where he ſtrode, on
his rock, amid his ſettling ſoul. The hoſt lie,
along the field. Sleep deſcends on Moi-lena.
The voice of Fonar aſcends alone, beneath his
diſtant tree. It aſcends in the praiſe of Cath-

They roll dark below him; he rejoices in the robe of his
beams. But when feeble deeds wander on the ſoul of the
king, he is a darkened ſun rolled along the ſky: the valley is

@15 Lear-thon, {{ſea wave}}, the name of the chief of that colony
of the Fir-bolg, which firſt migrated into Ireland. Larthon's
firſt ſettlement in that country is related in the ſeventh book.
He was the anceſtor of Cathmor ; and is here called {{Larthon
of Lumon}}, from a high hill of that name in Inis-huna, the an-
cient ſeat of the Fir-bolg. The character of Cathmor is pre-
ſerved. He had mentioned, in the firſt book, the averſion of
that chief to praiſe, and we find him here lying at the ſide of
a ſtream, that the noiſe of it might drown the voice of Fonar,
who, according to the cuſtom of the times, ſung his eulogium
in his {{evening ſong}}. Though other chiefs, as well as Cath-
mor, might be averſe to hear their own praiſe, we find it the
univerſal policy of the times, to allow the bards to be as ex-
travagant as they pleaſed in their encomiums on the leaders of
armies, in the preſence of their people. The vulgar, who had
no great ability to judge for themſelves, received the charac-
ters of their princes, entirely upon the faith of their bards.
