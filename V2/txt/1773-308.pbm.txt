of a ſtream. The ruſtling breeze of night flew
over his whiſtling locks,

{His} brother came to his dreams, half-ſeen
from his low-hung cloud. Joy roſe darkly in
his face. He had hcard the ſong of Carril @16.
A blaſt ſuſtained his dark-ſkirted cloud ; which
he ſeized in the boſom of night, as he roſe, with
his fame, towards his airy hall. Half-mixed
with the noiſe of the ſtream, he poured his feeble
words.

was heard on Moi-lena. The bard gave his
ſong to Cairbar. He travels on the wind. My
form is in my father's hall, like the gliding of

@16 Carril, the ſon of Kinfena, by the orders of Oſſian, ſung
the funeral elegy at the tomb of Cairbar. See the ſecond book,
towards the end. In all theſe poems, the viſits of ghoſts, to
their living friends, are ſhort, and their language obſcure,

theſe ſupernatural ſcenes. Towards the latter end of the
ſpeech of the ghoſt of Cairbar, he ſoretels the death of Cath-
mor, by enumerating thoſe ſignals which, according to the
opinion of the times, preceded the death of a perſon renowned.
It was thought that the ghoſts of deceaſed bards ſung, for three
nights preceding the death (near the place where his tomb was
to be raiſed) round an unſubſtantial figure which repreſented
the body of the perſon who was to die.
