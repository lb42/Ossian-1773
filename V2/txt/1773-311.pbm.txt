90 TEMORA: Book IV.
--
is a pleaſant gale. The mournful ſounds ariſe !
On Lubar's field there is a voice ! Louder fill,
ye ſhadowy ghoſts ! The dead were full of fame!
Shrilly ſwells the feeble ſound. The rougher
blaſt alone is heard ! Ah, ſoon is Cathmor
low!” Rolled into himſelf he flew, wide on the
boſom of winds. The old oak felt his depar-
ture, and ſhook its whiſtling head. Cathmor
ſtarts from reſt. He takes his deathful ſpear.
He lifts his eyes around. He ſees but dark-
ſkirted night.

{It} @17 was the voice of the king,” he ſaid.
``But now his form is gone. Unmarked is your
path in the air, ye children of the night. Often
like a reflected beam, are ye ſeen in the deſart
wild : but ye retire in your blaſts, before our
ſteps approach. Go then, ye feeble race!
Knowledge with you there is none ! Your joys
are weak, and like the dreams of our reſt, or
the light-winged thought, that flies acroſs the
ſoul. Shall Cathmor ſoon be low ? Darkly laid
in his narrow houſe ? Where no morning comes,
with her half-opened eyes? Away, thou ſhade!
==
@17The ſoliloquy of Cathmor ſuits the magnanimity of his
character. Though ſtaggered at firſt with the prediction of
Cairbar's ghoſt, he ſoon comforts himſelf with the agreeable
proſpect of his future renown; and, like Achilles, prefers a
ſhort and glorious life, to an obſcure length of years in retire-
ment and eaſe.
