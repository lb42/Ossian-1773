but he is ſtill unknown. In a blaſt comes cloudy
death, and lays his grey head low. His ghoſt is

@18 An indolent and unwarlike life was held in extreme
contempt. Whatever a philoſopher may ſay, in praiſe of
quiet and retirement, I am far from thinking, but they weaken
and debaſe the human mind. When the faculties of the ſoul
are not exerted, they loſe their vigour, and low and circum-
ſcribed notions take the place of noble and enlarged ideas.
Action, on the contrary, and the viciſſitudes of fortune which
attend it, call forth, by turns, all the powers of the mind,
and, by exerciſing, ſtrengthen them. Hence it is, that in
great and opulent ſtates, when property and indolence are
ſecured to individuals, we ſeldom meet with that ſtrength of
mind, which is ſo common in a nation, not far advanced in
civilization. It is a curious, but juſt, obſervation ; that great
kingdoms ſeldom produce great characters, which muſt be al-
together attributed to that indolence and diſſipation, which are
the inſeparable companions of too much property and ſecurity.
Rome, it is certain, had more real great men within it, when
its power was confined within the narrow bounds of Latium,
than when its dominion extended over all the known world ;
and one petty ſtate of the Saxon heptarchy had, perhaps, as
much genuine ſpirit in it, as the two Britiſh kingdoms united.
As a ſtate, we are much more powerful than our anceſtors, but
we would loſe by comparing individuals with them.
