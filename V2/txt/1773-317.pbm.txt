roes, upon the ecchoing hills. My iſſuing forth
was with kings. My joy in dreadful plains :
where broken hoſts are rolled away, like ſeas be-
fore the wind.”

{So} ſpoke the king of Alnecma, brightening
in his rifing ſoul. Valour, like a pleaſant flame,
is gleaming within his breaſt. Stately is his
ſtride on the heath! The beam of eaſt is poured
around. He ſaw his grey hoſt on the field,
wide-ſpreading their ridges in light. He re-
joiced, like a ſpirit of heaven, whoſe ſteps come
forth on the ſeas, when he beholds them peace-
ful round, and all the winds are laid. But ſoon
he awakes the waves, and rolls them large to ſome
ecchoing ſhore.

{On} the ruſhy bank of a ſtream, ſlept the
daughter of Inis-huna. The helmet had fallen
from her head. Her dreams were in the lands
of her fathers. {There} morning is on the field,
Grey ſtreams leap down from the rocks. The
breezes, in ſhadowy waves, fly over the ruſhy
fields. {There} is the ſound that prepares for
the chace. {There} the moving of warriors from
the hall. But tall above the reſt is ſeen the hero
of ſtreamy Atha. He bends his eye of love on
Sul-malla, from his ſtately ſteps. {She} turns,
with pride, her face away, and careleſs bends
the bow.
