_ARGUMENT to Book V._
The poet, after a ſhort addreſs to the harp of Cona, deſcribes the
arrangement of both armies on either ſide of the river Lubar.
Fingal gives the command to Fillan ; but, at the ſame time,
orders Gaul, the ſon of Morni, who had been wounded in
the hand in the preceding battle, to aſſiſt him with his
counſel. The army of the Fir-bolg is commanded by Fol-
dath. The general onſet is deſcribed. The great actions
of Fillan. He kills Rothmar and Culmin. But when Fil-
lan conquers, in one wing, Foldath preſſes hard on the
other. He wounds Dermid, the ſon of Duthno, and puts
the whole wing to flight. Dermid deliberates with himſelf,
and, at laſt, reſolves to put a ſtop to the progreſs of Foldath,
by engaging him in ſingle combat. When the two chiefs
were approaching towards one another, Fillan came ſud-
denly to the relief of Dermid ; engaged Foldath, and killed
him. The behaviour of Malthos towards the fallen Fol-
dath. Fillan puts the whole army of the Fir-bolg to flight.
The book cloſes with an addreſs to Clatho, the mother of
that hero.
