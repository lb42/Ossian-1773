AN

EPIC POEM.

BOOK V.

{Thou} dweller between the ſhields, that
hang, on high, in Oſſian's hall! De-
ſcend from thy place, O harp, and let me hear
thy voice! Son of Alpin, ſtrike the ſtring. Thou
muſt awake the ſoul of the bard. The murmur
of Lora's @1 ſtream has rolled the tale away. I
ſtand in the cloud of years. Few are its open-
ings toward the paſt; and when the viſion comes,
it is but dim and dark. I hear thee, harp of
Selma ! my ſoul returns, like a breeze, which
the ſun brings back to the vale, where dwelt the
lazy miſt !
==
@1 Lora is often mentioned; it was a ſmall and rapid ſtream
in the neighbourhood of Selma. There is no veſlige of this
name now remaining ; though it appears from a very old ſong,
which the tranſlator has ſeen, that one of the ſmall rivers on
the north-weſt coaſt was called Lora ſome centuries ago.
