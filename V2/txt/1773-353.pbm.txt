ſhone the field, when they mix their foam toge-
ther, from two dark-browed rocks ! Behold he
comes the ſon of fame | He lays the people low !
Deaths ſit on blaſts around him ! Warriors ſtrew
thy paths, O Fillan !

{Rothmar} @5, the ſhield of warriors, ſtood be-
tween two chinky rocks. Two oaks, which
winds had bent from high, ſpread their branches
on either ſide. He rolls his darkening eyes on
Fillan, and, ſilent, ſhades his friends. Fingal
ſaw the approaching fight. The hero's ſoul
aroſe. But as the ſtone of Loda @6 falls, ſhook,

@5 Roth-mar, {{the ſound of the ſea before a ſtorm}}. Druman-ard,
{{high-ridge}}. Cul-min, {{ſoft-haired}}. Cull-allin, {{beautiful locks}}.
Strutha, {{ſtreamy river}}.
@6 By the ſtone of Loda is meant a place of worſhip among
the Scandinavians. The Caledonians in their many expedi-
tions to Orkney and Scandinavia, became acquainted with
ſome of the rites of the religion, which prevailed in thoſe
countries, and the ancient poetry frequently alludes to them.
There are ſome ruins, and circular pales of ſtone, remaining
ſtill in Orkney, and the iſlands of Shetland, which retain, to
this day, the name of {{Loda}} or {{Loden}}. They ſeem to have dif-
fered materially, in their conſtruction, from thoſe Druidical
monuments which remain in Britain, and the weſtern iſles.
The places of worſhip among the Scandinavians were origi-
nally rude and unadorned. In after ages, when they opened
a communication with other nations, they adopted their man-
ners, and built temples. That at Upſal, in Sweden, was
amazingly rich and magnificent. Harquin, of Norway, built
one, near Drontheim, little inferior to the former; and it
went always under the name of Loden. {{Mallet, introduction a
