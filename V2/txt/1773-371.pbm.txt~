ſteps; and the big tear comes down. He ſounds
his father's horn. He thrice ſtrikes his boſſy
ſhield. He calls thrice the name of Foldath,
from his roaring tribes. Foldath, with joy,
beholds the chief. He lifts aloft his bloody
ſpear. As a rock is marked with ſtreams, that
fell troubled down its ſide in a ſtorm; ſo,
ſtreaked with wandering blood, is the dark chief
of Morna ! The hoſt, on either ſide, withdraw
from the contending of kings. They raiſe, at
once, their gleaming points. Ruſhing comes
Fillan of Selma. Three paces back Foldath
withdraws, dazzled with that beam of light,
which came, as iſſuing from a cloud, to ſave
the wounded chief. Growing in his pride he
ſtands. He calls forth all his ſteel.

{As} meet two broad-winged eagles, in their
ſounding ſtrife, in winds : ſo ruſh the two chiefs,
on Moi-lena, into gloomy fight. By turns are
the ſteps of the kings @10 forward on their rocks
above; for now the duſky war ſeems to deſcend
on their ſwords. Cathmor feels the joy of war-
riors, on his moſſy hill: their joy in ſecret,
when dangers rife to match their ſouls. His eye
is not turned on Lubar, but on Selma's dread-
ful king. He beholds him, on Mora, riſing in
his arms.
