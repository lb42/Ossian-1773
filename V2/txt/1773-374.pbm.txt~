Book V. An EPIC POEM. II
--

{Foldath} @11 falls on his ſhield. The ſpear
of Fillan pierced the king. Nor looks the youth
on the fallen, but onward rolls the war. The
hundred voices of death ariſe. `` Stay, ſon of
Fingal, ſtay thy ſpeed. Beholdeſt thou not that
gleaming form, - a dreadful ſign of death ?
==
@11 The fall of Foldath, if we may believe tradition, was
predicted to him, before he had left his own country to join
Cairbar, in his deſigns on the Iriſh throne. He went to the
cave of Morna, to enquire of the ſpirits of his fathers, con-
cerning the ſucceſs of the enterpriſe of Cairbar. The re-
ſponſes of oracles are always attended with obſcurity, and
liable to a double meaning: Foldath, therefore, put a favour-
able interpretation on the prediction, and purſued his adopted
plan of aggrandizing himſelf with the family of Atha,

%{Foldath}, {{addreſſing the ſpirits of his fathers}}.
Dark, I ſtand in your preſence; fathers of Foldath, hear.
Shall my ſteps paſs over Atha, to Ullin of the roes ?
%{{The Anſwer}}.
Thy ſteps ſhall paſs over Atha, to the green dwelling of
kings. There ſhall thy ſtature ariſe, over the ſallen, like a
pillar of thunder-clouds. There, terrible in darkneſs, ſhalt
thou ſtand, till the {{reflected beam}}, or {{Clon-cath}} of Moruth,
come; Moruth of many ſtreams, that roars in diſtant lands,”

Cloncath, or {{reflected beam}}, ſay my traditional authors,
was the name of the ſword of Fillan; ſo that it was, in the
latent ſignification of the word {{Clonath}}, that the deception
lay. My principal reaſon for introducing this note, is,
that this tradition ſerves to ſhew, that the religion of the
Fir-bolg differed from that of the Caledonians, as we ne-
ver find the latter enquiring of the ſpirits of their deceafed
anceſtors.
