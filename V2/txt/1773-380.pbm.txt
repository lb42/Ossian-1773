Book V. An EPIC POEM. 113
--

Dardu-lena !”

``{Rememberest} thou her,” ſaid Foldath,
`` becauſe no ſon is mine: no youth to roll the
battle before him, in revenge of me ? Malthos,
I am revenged. I was not peaceful in the field.
Raiſe the tombs of thoſe I have ſlain, around my
narrow houſe. Often ſhall I forſake the blaſt,
to rejoice above their graves; when I behold
them ſpread around, with their long-whiſtling
graſs.”

{His} ſoul ruſhed to the vale of Morna, to
Dardu-lena's dreams, where ſhe ſlept, by Dal-
rutho's ſtream, returning from the chace of the
hinds. Her bow is near the maid, unſtrung.
The breezes fold her long hair on her breaſts.
Cloathed in the beauty of youth, the love of
heroes lay. Dark-bending, from the ſkirts of
the wood, her wounded father ſeemed to come.
He appeared, at times, then hid himſelf in
miſt. Burfting into tears ſhe roſe. She knew
that the chief was low. To her came a beam
from his ſoul, when folded in its ſtorms.

lena; {{the dark wood of Moi-lena}}. As Foldath was proud and
oſtentatious, it would appear, that he transferred the name
of a place, where he himſelf had been victorious, to his
daughter.
