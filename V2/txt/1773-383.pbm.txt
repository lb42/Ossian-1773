114 T E M O R A: Book V.
--
Thou wert the laſt of his race, O blue-eyed
Dardu-lena !

{Wide-spreading} over ecchoing Lubar,
the flight of Bolga is rolled along. Fillan
hangs forward on their ſteps. He ſtrews, with
dead, the heath. Fingal rejoices over his ſon.
Blue-ſhielded Cathmor roſe@15.

{Son} of Alpin, bring the harp. Give Fillan's
praiſe to the wind. Raiſe high his praiſe, in
mine ear, while yet he ſhines in war.

``{Leave}, blue-eyed Clatho, leave thy hall !
Behold that early beam of thine! The hoſt is
withered in its courſe. No further look, it is
dark. Light-trembling from the harp, ſtrike,
virgins, ſtrike the ſound. No hunter he de-
ſcends, from the dewy haunt of the bounding
roe. He bends not his bow on the wind ; nor
ſends his grey arrow abroad.

@15 ``The ſuſpence, in which the mind of the reader is left
here, conveys the idea of Fillan's danger more forcibly
home, than any deſcription that could be introduced. There
is a ſort of eloquence, in ſilence with propriety. A minute
detail of the circumſtances of an important ſcene is generally
cold and inſipid. The human mind, free and fond of think-
ing for itſelf, is diſguſted to find every thing done by the
poet. It is, therefore, his buſineſs only to mark the moſt
ſtriking out-lines, and to allow the imaginations of his readers
to finiſh the figure for themſelves.”

The book ends in the aſternoon of the third day, from the
opening of the poem.
