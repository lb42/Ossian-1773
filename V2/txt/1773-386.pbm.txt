Book V. An EPIC POEM. 115
--
{Deep-folded} in red war! See battle roll
againſt his ſide. Striding amid the ridgy ſtrife,
he pours the deaths of thouſands forth. Fillan
is like a ſpirit of heaven, that deſcends from the
ſkirt of winds. The troubled ocean feels his
ſteps, as he ſtrides from wave to wave. His
path kindles behind him. Iflands ſhake their
heads on the heaving ſeas! Leave, blue-eyed
Clatho, leave thy hall!
