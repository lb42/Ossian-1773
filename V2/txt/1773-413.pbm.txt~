Oſſian, I begin to fail. Lay me in that hollow
rock. Raiſe no ſtone above, left one ſhould aſk

fields; fallen without renown. Let thy voice

%{Clatho}.
``Daughter of Fingal, ariſe : thou light between thy locks.
Lift thy fair head from reſt, foſt-gliding ſun-beam of Selma!
I beheld thy arms, on thy breaſt, white-toſſed amidſt thy
wandering locks: when the ruſtling breeze of the morning
came from the deſart of ſtreams. Haſt thou ſeen thy fathers,

darkening wave of a breeze, along a field of graſs. Deſcend,
from thy wall, O harp, and call back the ſoul of Bos-mina.
It has rolled away, like a ſtream, I hear thy pleaſant ſound.
I hear thee, O harp, and my voice ſhall riſe.

How often ſhall ye ruſh to war, ye dwellers of my ſoul ?
Your paths are diſtant, kings of men, in Erin of blue ſtreams.
Lift thy wing, thou ſouthern breeze, from Clono's darkening
heath : ſpread the ſails of Fingal towards the bays of his land.

But who is that, in his ſtrength, darkening in the preſence
of war? His arm ſtretches to the foe, like the beam of the
fickly ſun ; when his ſide is cruſted with darkneſs; and he
rolls his diſmal courſe through the ſky. Who is it, but the
father of Eos-mina ? Shall he return till danger is paſt!
