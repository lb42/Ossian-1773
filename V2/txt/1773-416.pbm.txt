Book VI. An EPIC POEM. 126
--
``{Is} thy ſpirit on the eddying winds, O Fil-
lan, young breaker of ſhield ! Joy purſue my
hero, through his folded clouds. The forms of
thy fathers, O Fillan, bend to receive their ſon.
I behold the ſpreading of their fire on Mora :
the blue-rolling of their miſty wreaths. Joy
meet thee my brother! But we are dark and
ſad! I Behold the foe round the aged. I be-
hold the waſting away of his fame. Thou art
left alone in the field, O grey-haired king of

Pleaſant to the ear of Clatho is the name of the breaker of
ſhield. Behold, the king comes from ocean : the ſhield of
Morven is borne by bards. The foe has fled before him, like
the departure of miſt. I hear not the ſounding wings of my
eagle; the ruſhing forth of the ſon of Clatho. Thou art
dark, O Fingal ; ſhall the warrior never return?  * * *
