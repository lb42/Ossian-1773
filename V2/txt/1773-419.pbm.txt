126 T E M O R A: Book VI,
--
ſtride was in the clang of ſteel. ``I will find
thee, king of Erin! in the gathering of thy
thouſands find thee. Why ſhould that cloud
eſcape, that quenched our early beam? Kindle
your meteors on your hills, my fathers. Light
my daring ſteps. I will conſume in wrath @6.
But ſhould not I return ! The king is without a
ſon, grey-haired among his foes! His arm is
not as in the days of old. His fame grows dim
in Erin. Let me not behold him, laid low in
his latter field. But can I return to the king ?
Will he not aſk about his ſon ? ``Thou oughteſt
to defend young Fillan.” Oſſian will meet the
foe! Green Erin, thy ſounding tread is pleaſant

@6 Here the ſentence is deſignedly left unfiniſhed. The ſenſe
is, that he was reſolved, like a deſtroying fire, to conſume
Cathmor, who had killed his brother. In the midſt of this
reſolution, the ſituation of Fingal ſuggeſts itſelf to him, in a
very ſtrong light. He reſolves to return to aſſiſt the king in
proſecuting the war. But then his ſhame for not defending
his brother, recurs to him. He is determined again to go
and find out Cathmor. We may conſider him, as in the act
of advancing towards the enemy, when the horn of Fingal
ſounded on Mora, and called back his people to his preſence.
This ſoliloquy is natural : the reſolutions which ſo ſuddenly
follow one another, are expreſſive of a mind extremely agi-
tated with ſorrow and conſcious ſhame ; yet the behaviour of
Oſſian, in his execution of the commands of Fingal, is ſo irre-
prehenſible, that it is not eaſy to determine where he failed
in his duty. The truth is, that when men fail in deſigns
which they ardently wiſh to accompliſh, they naturally blame
themſelves, as the chief cauſe of their diſappointment.
