Book VI. An EPIC POEM. 129
--

``{Where} is the ſon of Selma, he who led in
war? I behold not his ſteps, among my people,
returning from the field. Fell the young bound-
ing roe, who was ſo ſtately on my hills? He fell;
for ye are ſilent. The ſhield of war is cleft in
twain, Let his armour be near to Fingal ; and the
ſword of dark-brown Luno. I am waked on my
hills; with morning I deſcend to war.”

{High}@9 on Cormul's rock, an oak is flaming
to the wind. The grey ſkirts of miſt are rolled
around ; thither ſtrode the King in his wrath.

execution of his authority ; and even then he ſeldom extended

Highlands. No corporal puniſhment, of any kind, was in-
flicted. The memory of an affront of this ſort would remain,
for ages, in a family, and they would ſeize every opportunity
to be revenged, unleſs it came immediately from the hands of
the chief himſelf; in that caſe it was taken, rather as a fa-
therly correction, than a legal puniſhment for offences.
@9 This rock of Cormul is often mentioned in the preceding
part of the poem, It was on it Fingal and Oſſian ſtood to view
the battle. The cuſtom of retiring from the army, on the
night prior to their engaging in battle, was univerſal among
the kings of the Caledonians. Trenmor, the moſt renowned
of the anceſtors of Fingal, is mentioned as the firſt who inſti-
tated this cuſtom. Succeeding bards attributed it to a hero of
a latter period. In an old poem, which begins with {{Mac-
Arcath na ceud ſr&oacute;l}}, this cuſtom of retiring from the army, be-
fore an engagement, is numbered, among the wiſe inſtitutions
of Fergus, the ſon of Arc or Arcath, the firft king of Scots. I
