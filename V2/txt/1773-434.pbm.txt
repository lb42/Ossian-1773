Book VI. An EPIC POEM. 131
--
ſhield of Clatho's ſon; and near it, on graſs, lay
hairy-footed Bran @10. He had miſſed the chief
on Mora, and ſearched him along the wind.
He thought that the blue-eyed hunter ſlept ; he
lay upon his ſhield. No blaſt came over the
heath, unknown to bounding Bran.

{Cathmor} ſaw the white-breaſted dog; he
ſaw the broken ſhield. Darkneſs is blown back
on his ſoul; he remembers the falling away of
the people. They come, a ſtream ; are rolled
away ; another race ſucceeds, `` But ſome mark
the fields, as they paſs, with their own mighty

@10 I remember to have met with an old poem, where-
in a ſtory of this ſort is very happily introduced. In
one of the invaſions of the Danes, Ullin-clundu, a conſi-
derable chief, on the weſtern coaſt of Scotland, was killed in
a rencounter with a flying party of the enemy, who had
landed, at no great diſtance, from the place of his reſidence.
The few followers who attended him were alſo ſlain. The
young wife of Ullin-clundu, who had not heard of his fall.
fearing the worſt, on account of his long delay, alarmed the
reſt of his tribe, who went in ſearch of him along the ſhore.
They did not find him; and the beautiful widow became diſ-
conſolate. At length he was diſcovered, by means of his dog,
who ſat on a rock beſide the body, for ſome days. The
ſtanza concerning the dog, whoſe name was Du-chos, or
{{Blackfoot}}, is deſcriptive.

``Dark-ſided Du-chos! feet of wind! cold is thy ſeat on
rocks. He (the dog) ſees the roe: his ears are high ; and
half he bounds away, He looks around ; but Ullin ſleeps;
he droops again his head. The winds come paſt ; dark Du-
chos thinks, that Ullin's voice is there. But ſtill he beholds
him ſilent, laid amidſt the waving heath. Dark ſided Du-
chos, his voice no more ſhall ſend thee over the heath !”
