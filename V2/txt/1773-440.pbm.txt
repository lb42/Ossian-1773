Book VI An EPIC POEM. 132
--
there among them, who can lift the ſpear ? Not
ſo peaceful was thy father, Borbar-duthul@12,
king of ſpears. His rage was a fire that al-
ways burned : his joy over fallen foes was great.
Three days feaſted the grey-haired hero, when
he heard that Calmar fell : Calmar, who aided
the race of Ullin, from Lara of the ſtreams.
Often did he feel, with his hands, the ſteel
which, they ſaid, had pierced his foe. He felt
it, with his hands, for Borbar-duthul's eyes had

@12 Borbar-duthul, the father of Catkmor, was the brother of
that Colc-ulla, who is ſaid, in the beginning of the fourth
book, to have rebelled againſt Cormac king of Ireland.
Borbar-duthul ſeems to have retained all the prejudice of his
family againſt the ſucceſſion of the poſterity of Conar, on the
Iriſh throne. From this ſhort epiſode we learn ſome facts
which tend to throw light on the hiſtory of the times. It ap-
pears, that, when Swaran invaded Ireland, he was only op-
poſed by the Cael, who poſſeſſed Ulſter, and the north of that
iſland. Calmar, the ſon of Matha, whoſe gallant behaviour
and death are related in the third book of Fingal, was the
only chief of the race of the Fir-bolg, that joined the Cael, or
Iriſh Caledonians, during the invaſion of Swaran. The inde-
cent joy, which Borbar-duthul expreſſed, upon the death of
Calmar, is well ſuited with that ſpirit of revenge, which ſub-
ſiſted, univerſally, in every country where the feudal ſyſtem
was eſtabliſhed. Tt would appear that ſome perſon had carried
to Borbar-duthul that weapon, with which, it was pretended,
Calmar had been killed.
