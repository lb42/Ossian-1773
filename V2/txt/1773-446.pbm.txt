Book VI, An EPIC POEM. 135
--
They raiſed the ſong, and touched the ſtring :
each to the chief he loved. Before a burn-
ing oak Sul-malla touched, at times, the harp.
She touched the harp, and heard, between, the
breezes in her hair. In darkneſs near, lay the
king of Atha, beneath an aged tree. The beam
of the oak was turned from him ; he ſaw the
maid, but was not ſeen. His ſoul poured forth,
==
death of a perſon, worthy and renowned, ſlain in the war.
The words were of the compoſition of the arch-bard, retained
by the king himſelf, who generally attained to that high office
on account of his ſuperior genius for poetry. As the perſons
of the bards were ſacred, and the emoluments of their office
conſiderable, the order, in ſucceeding times, became very
numerous and inſolent. It would appear, that, after the in-
troduction of Chriſtianity, ſome ſerved in the double capacity
of bards and clergymen. It was, from this circumſtance, that
they had the name of {{Chl&eacute;re}}, which is, probably, derived from
the Latin Clericus. The {{Chl&eacute;re}}, be their name derived from
what it will, became, at laſt, a public nuiſance; for, taking
advantage of their ſacred character, they went about, in great
bodies, and lived, at diſcretion, in the houſes of the chiefs ;
till another party, of the ſame order, drove them away by
mere dint of ſatire. Some of the indelicate diſputes of theſe
worthy poetical combatants are handed down, by tradition,
and ſhew how much the bards, at laſt, abuſed the privileges,
which the admiration of their countrymen had conferred on
the order. It was this inſolent behaviour that induced the
chiefs to retrench their number, and to take away thoſe privi-
leges which they were no longer worthy to enjoy. Their in-
dolence, and diſpoſition to lampoon, extinguiſhed all the poe-
tical fervour, which diſtinguiſhed their predeceſſors, and makes
us the leſs regret the extinction of the order.
