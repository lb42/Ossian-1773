Book VI. Aw EPIC POEM 137
--
not on the ridgy heath, My eye is turned to
the king, whoſe path is terrible in war. He
for whom my ſoul is up, in the ſeaſon of my
reſt. Deep-boſomed in war he ſtands, he be-
holds me not from his cloud. Why, ſun of Sul-
malla, doſt thou not look forth ? I dwell in dark-
neſs here; wide over me flies the thadowy miſt.
Filled with dew are my locks : look thou from
thy cloud, O ſun of Sul-malla's ſoul.”  * * *
