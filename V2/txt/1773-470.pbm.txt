Book VI. An EPIC POEM. 143
--
Clatho ? Dwells the father of the fallen in reſt ?
Am I forgot in the folds of darkneſs; lonely in
the ſeaſon of night ?”

``{Why} doſt thou mix, ſaid the king, with the
dreams of thy father? Can I forget thee, my
ſon, or thy path of fire in the field ? Not ſuch
come the deeds of the valiant on the ſoul of
Fingal. They are not there a beam of light-
ning, which is ſeen, and is then no more. I
remember thee, O Fillan, and my wrath begins
to riſe.”

{The} king took his deathful ſpear, and ſtruck
the deeply-ſounding ſhield : his ſhield that hung
high in night, the diſmal ſign of war ! Ghoſts fled
on every ſide, and rolled their gathered forms on
the wind. Thrice from the winding vale aroſe
the voice of deaths. The harps @3 of the bards,
untouched, ſound mournful over the hill.
==
@3 It was the opinion of ancient times, that, on the night
preceding the death of a perſon worthy and renowned, the
harps of thoſe bards, who were retained by his family, emit-
ted melancholy ſounds. This was attributed to {{the light touch
of ghofts}}; who were ſuppofed to have a fore-knowlege of
events. The ſame opinion prevailed long in the north, and
the particular found was called, {{the warning voice of the dead}}.
{{The voice of death}}, mentioned in the preceding ſentence, was
of a different kind. Each perſon was ſuppoſed to have an
attendant ſpirit, who aſſumed his form and voice, on the
night preceding his death, and appeared, to ſome, in the
attitude, in which the perſon was to die. The {voices of
death} were the ſoreboding ſhrieks of thoſe ſpirits.
