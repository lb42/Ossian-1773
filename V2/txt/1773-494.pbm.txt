ing roe. Wide, in the midſt, aroſe the cloud-
leſs beams of Ton-thena, that ſtar which looked,
by night, on the courſe of the ſea-toſſed Lar-

of his poem is not deſtitute of merit; but it is the only
part of it, that I think worthy of being preſented to the
reader.

``Who firſt ſent the black ſhip, thro' ocean, like a whale

blue-rolling waters, that I may behold the king. I ſee him
