152 T E MO R A: Book VIII.
--
{Beneath} the ſpear of Cathmor, roſe that
voice which awakes the bards. They came,
dark-winding, from every ſide; each with the
ſound of his harp. Before them rejoiced the
king, as the traveller, in the day of the ſun;
when he hears, far-roiling around, the murmur
of moſſy ſtreams ; ſtreams that butſt, in the de-
ſart, from the rock of roes.

``{Why},” ſaid Fonar, ``hear we the voice of
the king, in the ſeaſon of his reſt? Were the dim
forms of thy fathers bending in thy dreams ?
Perhaps they ſtand on that cloud, and wait for
Fonar's ſong; often they come to the fields
where their ſons are to lift the ſpear. Or ſhall
our voice ariſe for him who lifts the ſpear no
more; he that conſumed the field, from Morna
of the groves ?”

``{Not} forgot is that cloud in war, bard
of other times. High ſhall his tomb rife, on
Moi-lena, the dwelling of renown. But, now,
==
dark in his own ſhell of oak! ſea-toſſed Larthon, thy ſoul is
ſtrong. It is careleſs as the wind of thy ſails; as the wave
that rolls by thy ſide. But the ſilent green iſle is before thee,
with its ſons, who are tall as woody Lumon ; Lumon which
ſends, from its top, a thouſand ſtreams, white-wandering
down its ſides.”

It may, perhaps, be ſor the credit of this bard, to tranſlate
no more of this poem, for the continuation of his deſcription
of the Iriſh giants betrays his want of judgment.
