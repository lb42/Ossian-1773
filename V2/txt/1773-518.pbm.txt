_T E M O R A:
A N
EPIC POEM.
BOOK VIII._
{As} when the wintry winds have ſeized the
waves of the mountain-lake, have ſeized
them, in ſtormy night, and cloathed them over
with ice; white, to the hunter's early eye, the
billows ſtill ſeem to roll. He turns his ear to the
ſound of each unequal ridge. But each is ſilent,
gleaming, ſtrewn with boughs and tufts of graſs,
which ſhake and whiſtle to the wind, over their
grey ſeats of froſt. So ſilent ſhone to the morn-
ing the ridges of Morven's hoft, as each warrior
looked up from his helmet towards the hill of
the king; the cloud-covered hill of Fingal,
where he ſtrode, in the folds of miſt. At times
is the hero ſeen, greatly dim in all his arms.
