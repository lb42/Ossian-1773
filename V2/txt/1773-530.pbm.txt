Book VIII. An EPIC POEM. 163
--
He comes, at times, abroad, in the ſkirts of
miſt, to pierce the bounding roes. When the
ſun looks on the field, nor by the rock; nor
ſtream, is he! He ſhuns the race of Bolga, who
dwell in his father's hall. Tell him, that Fingal
lifts the ſpear, and that his foes, perhaps, may
fail.”

``{Lift} up, O Gaul, the ſhield before him.
Stretch, Dermid, Temora's ſpear. Be thy voice
in his ear, O Carril, with the deeds of his fa-
thers. Lead him to green Moi-lena, to the duſky
field of ghoſts; for there, I fall forward, in
battle, in the folds of war. Before dun night de-
ſcends, come to high Dunmora's top. Look,
from the grey ſkirts of miſt, on Lena of the
ſtreams. If there my ſtandard ſhall float on
wind, over Lubar's gleaming ſtream, then has
not Fingal failed in the laſt of his fields.”

{Such} were his words; nor aught replied the
ſilent, ſtriding kings. They looked ſide-long,
on Erin's hoſt, and darkened, as they went.
Never before had they left the king, in the midſt
of the ſtormy field. Behind them, touching at
==
ſpear a fir of Cluna ? Is he a rough-winged blaſt, on the moun-
tain, which takes the green oak by the head, and tears it from
its hill? Glitters Lubar within his ſtride, when he ſends his
flately ſteps along. Nor is he tall, ſaid Gaul, as that rock:
nor glitter ſtreams within his ſtrides, but his ſoul is a mighty
flood, like the ſtrength of Ullin's ſeas.”
