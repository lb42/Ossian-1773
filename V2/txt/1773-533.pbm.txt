times his harp, the grey-haired Carril moved.
He foreſaw the fall of the people, and mournful
was the ſound! It was like a breeze that comes,
by fits, over Lego's reedy lake ; when ſleep half--

``{Why} bends the bard of Cona,” ſaid Fingal,
``over his ſecret ſtream ? Is this a time for ſorrow,

``Malvina is like the bow of the ſhower, in the ſecret val-

the nightly beam ? Should the young warrior fall, in the roar
of his troubled fields! Young virgins of Lutha ariſe, call back
the wandering thoughts of Malvina. Awake the voice of the
harp, along my ecchoing vale. Then ſhall my ſoul come
forth, like a light from the gates of the morn, when clouds are
rolled around them, with their broken ſides.

``Dweller of my thoughts, by night, whoſe form aſcends
in troubled fields, why doſt thou ſtir up my ſoul, thou far-
diſtant ſon of the king ? is that the ſhip of my love, its dark
courſe through the ridges of ocean? How art thou ſo ſudden,
Oſcar, from the heath of ſhields ?”

The reſt of this poem conſiſts of a dialogue between Ullin
and Malvina, wherein the diſtreſs of the latter is carried to the
higheſt pitch.
