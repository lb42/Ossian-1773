{White-breasted} Bran came bounding with
joy to the known path of Fingal. He came,
and looked towards the cave, where the blue--
eyed hunter lay, for he was wont to ſtride, with
morning, to the dewy bed of the roe. It was
then the tears of the king came dawn, and all

@3 The Iriſh compoſitions concerning Fingal invariably
ſpeaks of him as a giant. Of theſe Hibernian poems there are
now many in my hands. From the language, and alluſions
to the times in which they were writ, I ſhould fix the date of
their compoſition in the fifteenth and ſixteenth centuries. In
ſome paſſages, the poetry is far from wanting merit, but the
fable is unnatural, and the whole conduct of the pieces inju-
dicious. I ſhall give one inſtance of the extravagant fictions
of the Iriſh bards, in a poem which they, moſt unjuſtly,
aſcribe to Oſſian. The ſtory of it is this: Ireland being
threatened with an invaſion from ſome part of Scandinavia,
Fingal ſent Oſſian, Oſcar, and Ca-olt, to watch the bay, in
which, it was expected, the enemy was to land. Oſcar, un-
luckily, fell aſleep, before the Scandinavians appeared ; and,
great as he was, ſays the Iriſh bard, he had one bad property,
that no leſs could waken him, before his time, than cutting
off one of his fingers, or throwing a great ſtone againſt his
head ; and it was dangerous to come near him on thoſe occa-
ſions, till he had recovered himſelf, and was fully awake.
