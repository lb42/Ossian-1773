Book VIII, An EPIC POEM. 169
--
{Nor} did Ofſian forget the ſpear, in the wing
of his war. He ſtrewed the field with dead.
Young Hidalla came. ``Soft voice of ſtreamy
Clonra ! Why doſt thou lift the ſteel? O that
we met, in the ſtrife of ſong, in thy own ruſhy
vale !" Malthos beheld him low, and darkened
as he ruſhed along. On either ſide of a ſtream,
we bend in the ecchoing ſtrife. Heaven comes
rolling down : around burſt the voices of ſqually
winds. Hills are clothed, at times, in fire.
==
Thou thinkeſt of the battles of Ofſian, young ſon of the eccho-
ing iſle !
`` Half hid, in the grove, I ſit down. Fly back, ye miſts
of the hill. Why ſhould ye hide her love from the blue eyes
of Tlamin of harps?
%{Clonar}.
``As the ſpirit, ſeen in a dream, flies off from our opening
eyes, we think, we behold his bright path between the cloſ-
ing hills ; ſo fled the daughter of Clun-gal, from the ſight of
Clonar of ſhields. Ariſe, from the gathering of trees; blue-
eyed Tlamin ariſe.
%{Tlamin}.
``I turn me away from his ſteps, Why ſhould he know of
my love! My white breaſt is heaving over ſighs, as foam on
the dark courſe of ſtreams. But he paſſes away, in his arms !
Son of Conglas, my ſoul is ſad.
%{Cronar},
``It was the ſhield of Fingal! the voice of kings from Sel-
ma of harps! My path is towards green Erin. Ariſe, fair
light, from thy ſhades. Come to the field of my ſoul, there
is the ſpreading of hoſts. Ariſe, on Clonar's troubled ſoul,
young daughter of blue ſhielded Clungal.”
$
Clungal was the chief of I-mor, one of the Hebrides.
