170 T E M O R A: Book VIII.
--
Thunder rolls in wreaths of miſt. In darkneſs
ſhrunk the foe : Morven's warriors ſtood aghaſt.
Still I bent over the ſtream, amidſt my whiſtling
locks.

{Then} roſe the voice of Fingal, and the ſound
of the flying foe. I ſaw the king, at times, in
lightning, darkly-ſtriding in his might. I ſtruck
my ecchoing ſhield, and hung forward on the
ſteps of Alnecma : the foe is rolled before me,
like a wreath of ſmoak.

{The} ſun looked forth from his cloud. The
hundred ſtreams of Moi-lena ſhone. Slow roſe
the blue columns of miſt, againſt the glittering
hill. ``Where are the mighty kings ?@5 Nor by
that ſtream, nor wood, are they ! I hear the
clang of arms! Their ſtrife is in the boſom of
==
@5 Fingal and Cathmor. The conduct here is perhaps proper.
The numerous deſcriptions of ſingle combats have already
exhauſted the ſubject. Nothing new, nor adequate to our
high idea of the kings, can be ſaid. {{A column of miſt}} is
thrown over the whole, and the combat is left to the imagi-
nation of the reader. Poets have almoſt univerſally failed in
their deſcriptions of this ſort. Not all the ſtrength of Homer
could ſuſtain, with dignity, the {{minuti&aelig;}} of a fingle combat.
The throwing of a ſpear, and the braying of a ſhield, as ſome
of our own poets moſt elegantly expreſs it, convey no magni-
ficent, though they are ſtriking ideas. Our imagination
ſtretches beyond, and conſequently, deſpiſes, the deſcription.
It were, therefore, well, for ſome poets, in my opinion, (tho'
it is, perhaps, ſomewhat ſingular) to have, ſometimes, thrown
{{miſt}} over their ſingle combats.
