the herbs of the hills. I ſeized their fair heads,
on high, as they waved by their ſecret ſtreams.
Thou art dark and ſilent, king of Atha of ſtran-
gers.”

``{By} Atha of the ſtream,” he ſaid, ``there riſes
a moſſy rock. On its head is the wandering of
boughs, within the courſe of winds. Dark, in its
face, is a cave, with its own loud rill. There
have I heard the tread of ſtrangers@7, when they
paſſed to my hall of ſhells. Joy roſe, like a
flame, on my ſoul: I bleſt the ecchoing rock.
Here be my dwelling, in darkneſs; in my graſſy
vale. From this I ſhall mount the breeze, that
purſues my thiſtle's beard; or look down,
on blue-winding Atha, from its wandering
miſt.”

@7 Cathmor reflects, with pleaſure, even in his laſt mo-
ments, on the relief he had afforded to ftrangers. The very
tread of their feet was pleafant in his ear. His hoſpitality
was not paſſed unnoticed by the bards; for, with them, it
became a proverb, when they deſcribed the hoſpitable diſpo-
ſition of a hero, {{that he was like Cathmor of Atha, the friend
of ſtrangers}}. It will ſeem ſtrange, that, in all the Iriſh poems,
there is no mention made of Cathmor. This muſt be attri-
buted to the revolutions and domeſtic confuſions which hap-
pened in that iſland, and utterly cut off all the real traditions
concerning ſo ancient a period. All that we have related of
the ſtate of lreland before the fifth century is of late inven-
tion, aud the work of ill informed ſenachies and injudicious
bards.
