{Evening} came down on Moi-lena, Grey
rolled the ſtreams of the land. Loud came forth
the voice of Fingal : the beam of oaks aroſe.
The people gathered round with gladneſs ; with
gladneſs blended with ſhades. They ſidelong
looked to the king, and beheld his unfiniſhed
joy. Pleaſant, from the way of the deſart, the
voice of muſic came. It ſeemed, at firſt, the
noiſe of a ſtream, far-diſtant on its rocks. Slow
it rolled along the hill, like the ruffled wing of a
breeze, when it takes the tufted beard of the
rocks, in the ſtill ſeaſon of night. It was the
voice of Condan, mixed with Carril's trembling
harp. They came, with blue-eyed Ferad-artho,
to Mora of the ſtreams.

lazy miſt, the man of many days. But he is unknown, Sul-
malla, like the thiſtle of the rocks of roes; it ſhakes its grey
beard, in the wind, and falls, unſeen of our eyes. Not ſuch
are the kings of men, their departure is a meteor of fire,
which pours its red courſe, from the deſart, over the boſom of
night.

``He is mixed with the warriors of old, thoſe fires that have
hid their heads. At times ſhall they come forth in ſong. Not
forgot has the warrior failed. He has not ſeen, Sul-malla,
the fall of a beam of his own: no fair-haired ſon, in his
blood, young troubler of the field. I am lonely, young
branch of Lumon, I may hear the voice of the feeble, when
my ſtrength ſhall have failed in years, for young Oſcar has
ceaſed, on his field,” — * *

Sul-malla returned to her own country, She makes a con-
ſiderable figure in another poem ; her behaviour in that piece
accounts for that partial regard with which the poet ought to
ſpeak of her throughout Temora,
