Book VIII. An EPIC POEM. 179
--
{Sudden} burſts the ſong from our bards, on
Lena : the hoſt ſtruck their ſhields midſt the
ſound. Gladneſs roſe brightening on the king,
like the beam of a cloudy day, when it riſes,
on the green hill, before the roar of winds. He
ſtruck the boſſy ſhield of kings; at once they
ceaſe around. The people lean forward, from
their ſpears, towards the voice of their land @14.

``{Sons} of Morven, ſpread the feaſt ; ſend the
night away in ſong. Ye have ſhone around me;
and the dark ſtorm is paſt. My people are the
windy rocks, from which I ſpread my eagle-

@14 Before I finiſh my notes, it may not be altogether impro-
per to obviate an objection, which may be made to the cre-
dibility of the ſtory of Temora. It may be aſked, whether
it is probable, that Fingal could perform ſuch actions as are
aſcribed to him in this book, at an age when his grandſon,
Oſcar, had acquired ſo much reputation in arms. To this it may
be anſwered, that Fingal was but very young [book 4th] when
he took to wife Ros-crana, who ſoon after became the mother
of Oſſian. Oſſian was alſo extremely young when he married
Ever-allin, the mother of Oſcar. Tradition relates, that
Fingal was but eighteen years old at the birth of his ſon
Oſſian ; and that Oſſian was much about the ſame age, when
Oſcar, his ſon, was born. Oſcar, perhaps, might be about
twenty, when he was killed, in the battle of Gabhra, [book 1ſt]
ſo the age of Fingal, when the deciſive battle was fought be-
tween him and Cathmor, was juſt fifty-ſix years. In thoſe
times of activity and health, the natural ſtrength and vigour
of a man was little abated, at ſuch an age ; ſo that there is
nothing improbable in the actions of Fingal, as related in this
book.
