_ARGUMENT._
Conlath was the youngeſt of Morni's ſons, and brother to the
celebrated Gaul. He was in love with Cuth&oacute;na the daugh-
ter of Rumar, when Toſcar the ſon of Kinfena, accompanied
by Fercuth his friend, arrived, from Ireland, at Mora,
where Conlath dwelt. He was hoſpitably received, and
according to the cuſtom of the times, feaſted, three days,
with Conlath. On the fourth he ſet ſail, and coaſting
the {{iſland of waves}}, one of the Hebrides, he ſaw
Cuthona hunting, fell in love with her, and carried her
away, by force, in his ſhip. He was forced, by ſtreſs of
weather, into I-thona a deſart iſle. In the mean-time
Conlath, hearing of the rape, ſailed after him, and ſound
him on the point of ſailing for the coaſt of Ireland. They
fought; and they and their followers fell by mutual
wounds. Cuthona did not long ſurvive: for ſhe died of
grief the third day after. Fingal, hearing of their unfor-
tunate death, ſent Stormal the ſon of Moran to bury them,
but forgot to ſend a bard to ſing the funeral ſong over their
tombs. The ghoſt of Conlath comes, long after, to Oſſian,
to intreat him to tranſmit, to poſterity, his and Cuthona's
fame. For it was the opinion of the times, that the ſouls
of the deceaſed were not happy, till their elegies were com-
poſed by a bard.
