_CONLATH and CUTHONA;
A
P O E M._
{Did} not Oſſian hear a voice? or is it the
ſound of days that are no more? Often
does the memory of former times come, like
the evening ſun, on my ſoul. The noiſe of the
chace is renewed. In thought, I lift the ſpear.
But Oſſian did hear a voice ! Who art thou, ſon
of night ? The children of the feeble are aſleep.
The midnight wind is in my hall. Perhaps it is
the ſhield of Fingal that ecchoes to the blaſt.
It hangs in Oſſian's hall. He feels it ſometimes
with his hands. Yes! I hear thee, my friend !
Long has thy voice been abſent from mine ear !
What brings thee, on thy cloud, to Oſſian, ſon
of generous Morni? Are the friends of the aged
near thee? Where is Oſcar, ſon of fame? He
was often near thee, O Conlath, when the
ſound of battle aroſe.
