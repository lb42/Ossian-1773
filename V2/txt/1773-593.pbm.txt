134 CONLATH and CUTHONA:
--
%{Ghost} of {Conlath}.
{Sleeps} the ſweet voice of Cona, in the midſt
of his ruſtling hall ? Sleeps Oſſian in his hall,
and his friends without their fame? The ſea
rolls round dark I-thona @1. Our tombs are not
ſeen in our iſle. How long ſhall our fame be
unheard, ſon of reſounding Selma ?

%{Ossian}.
{O that} mine eyes could behold thee ! Thou
ſitteſt, dim, on thy cloud! Art thou like the
miſt of Lano? An half-extinguiſhed meteor of
fire? Of what are the ſkirts of thy robe? Of what
is thine airy bow? He is gone on his blaſt like the
ſhade of a wandering cloud. Come from thy wall,
O harp! Let me hear thy ſound. Let the light
of memory riſe on I-thona. Let me behold again
my friends ! And Oſſian does behold his friends,
on the dark-blue iſle. The cave of Thona ap-
pears, with its moſſy rocks and bending trees. A
ſtream roars at its mouth.  Toſcar bends over
its courſe, Fercuth is ſad by his ſide. Cuth&oacute;na @2
ſits at a diſtance, and weeps. Does the wind of
==
@1 I-thonn, {{iſland of waves}}, one of the uninhabited weſtern
iſles.
@2 Cuthona the daughter of Rumar, whom Toſcar had car-
ried away by force.
