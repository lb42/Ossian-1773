126 CONLATH and CUTHONA:
--
ſound of the harp in Selama@5. Lovely the cry
of the hunter on Cr&oacute;mla. But we are in dark
I-thona, ſurrounded by the ſtorm. The billows
lift their white heads above our rocks. We
tremble amidſt the night.

%{Toscar}.
{Whither} is the ſoul of battle fled, Fercuth
with locks of age? I have ſeen thee undaunted in
danger: thine eyes burning with joy in the
fight. Whither is the ſoul of battle fled? Our
fathers never feared. Go: view the ſettling
ſea : the ſtormy wind is laid. The billows ſtill
tremble on the deep. They ſeem to fear the
blaſt. Go view the ſettling ſea. Morning is
grey on our rocks. The ſun will look ſoon from
his eaſt; in all his pride of light! I lifted up
my ſails, with joy, before the halls of generous
Conlath. My courſe was by a deſart iſle :
where Cuthona purſued the deer. I ſaw her,
like that beam of the ſun that iſſues from the
cloud. Her hair was on her heaving breaſt.
She, bending forward, drew the bow. Her
white arm ſeemed, behind her, like the ſnow of
Cromla. Come to my ſoul, I ſaid, huntreſs
