A P O E M. 189
--
Her ſorrow was heard on Mora. Art thou pale
on thy rock, Cuthona, beſide the fallen chiefs ?
Night comes, and day returns, but none appears
to raiſe their tomb. Thou frighteneſt the
ſcreaming fowls away. Thy tears for ever flow.
Thou art pale as a watry cloud, that riſes from
a lake !

{The} ſons of green Selma came. They ſound
Cuthona cold. They raiſed a tomb over the
heroes. She reſts at the ſide of Conlath. Come
not to my dreams, O Conlath ! Thou haſt re-
ceived thy fame. Be thy voice far diſtant from
my hall; that ſleep may deſcend at night. O
that I could forget my friends : till my foot-
ſteps ſhould ceaſe to be ſeen! till I come among
them with joy! and lay my aged limbs in the
narrow houſe !
