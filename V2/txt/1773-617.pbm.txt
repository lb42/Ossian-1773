_ARGUMENT._
Fingal in his voyage to Lochlin, whither he had been
invited by Starno the father of Agandecca, touched at
Berrathon, an iſland of Scandinavia, where he was kindly
entertained by Larthmor the petty king of the place, who
was a vaſſal of the ſupreme kings of Lochlin. The hoſpi-
tality of Larthmor gained him Fingal's friendſhip, which
that hero manifeſted, after the impriſonment of Larthmor
by his own ſon, by ſending Oſſian and Toſcar, the father
of Malvina ſo often mentioned, to reſcue Larthmor, and
to puniſh the unnatural behaviour of Uthal. Uthal was
handſome, and, by the ladies, much admired. Nina-
thoma, the beautiful daughter of Torthoma, a neighbour-
ing prince, fell in love and fled with him. He proved uncon-
ſtant; for another lady, whoſe name is not mentioned,
gaining his affectons, he confined Nina-thoma to a deſart
iſland near the coaſt of Berrathon. She was relieved by
Oſſian, who, in company with Toſcar, landing on Berra-
thon, defeated the forces of Uthal, and killed him in a
ſingle combat. Nina-thoma, whoſe love not all the bad
behaviour of Uthal could eraſe, hearing of his death, died
of grief. In the mean time Larthmor is reſtored, and Oſſian
and Toſcar return in triumph to Fingal,

The poem opens with an elegy on the death of Malvina
the daughter of Toſcar, and cloſes with preſages of Oſſian's
death.
