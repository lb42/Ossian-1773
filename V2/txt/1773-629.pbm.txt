196 BERRATHON:
--
neſs dwells in the halls of Lutha. My aged
ſon @5 is ſad ! I hear the breeze of Cona, that was
wont to lift thy heavy locks. It comes to the
hall, but thou art not there. Its voice is mourn-
ful among the arms of thy fathers ! Go, with thy
ruſtling wing, O breeze! ſigh on Malvina's
tomb. It riſes yonder beneath the rock, at the
blue ſtream of Lutha. The maids @6 are departed
to their place. Thou alone, O breeze, mourneſt
there!”

{But} who comes from the duſky weſt, ſup-
ported on a cloud? A ſmile is on his grey,
watry face. His locks of miſt fly on wind. He
bends forward on his airy ſpear. It is thy fa-
ther, Malvina ! `` Why ſhineft thou, ſo ſoon,
on our clouds,” he ſays, ``O lovely light of
Lutha! But thou wert ſad, my daughter. Thy
friends had paſſed away. The ſons of little
men @7 were in the hall. None remained of the
heroes, but Oſſian king of ſpears !”

@5 Oſſian who had a great friendſhip for Malvina, both on
account of her love for his ſon Oſcar, and her attention to
himſelf.
@6 That is, the young virgins who ſung the funeral elegy
over her tomb.
@7 Tradition is entirely ſilent concerning what paſſed in the
north, immediately after the death of Fingal and all his he-
roes ; by which it would ſeem that the actions of their ſucceſſors
were not to be compared to thoſe of the renowned Fingalians.
