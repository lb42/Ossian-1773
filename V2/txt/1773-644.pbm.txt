ſword. Three youths carry his poliſhed bows.
The bounding of five dogs is before him. His
heroes move on, at a diſtance, admiring the
ſteps of the king. Stately was the ſon of Larth-
mor ! but his ſoul was dark! Dark as the
troubled face of the moon, when it foretels the
ſtorms !

{We} roſe on the heath before the king. He
ſtopt in the midſt of his courſe. His heroes ga-
thered around. A gray-haired bard advanced.
``Whence are the ſons of the ſtrangers !” began
the bard of ſong. ``The children of the un-
happy come to Berrathon; to the ſword of car-
borne Uthal. He ſpreads no feaſt in his hall.
The blood of ſtrangers is on his ſtreams. If
from Selma's walls ye come, from the moſſy
walls of Fingal, chuſe three youths to go to your
king to tell of the fall of his people. Perhaps the
hero may come and pour his blood on Uthal's
ſword. So ſhall the fame of Finthormo ariſe,
like the growing tree of the vale!”

``{Never} will it riſe, O bard,” I ſaid in the
pride of my wrath. `` He would ſhrink from
the preſence of Fingal, whofe eyes are the
flames of death. The ſon of Comhal comes,
and kings vanith before him. They are rolled
together, like miſt, by the breath of his rage.
Shall three tell to Fingal, that his people fell?
--
Yes!
