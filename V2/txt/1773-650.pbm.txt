Lethmal, the gray-haired bard of Selma. He
alone had remained on the coaſt, with the
daughter of Torthoma, `` Son of the times of
old !” ſhe ſaid, ``I hear the noiſe of death.
Thy friends have met with Uthal and the chief is
low ! O that I had remained on the rock, in-
cloſed with the tumbling waves! Then would
my ſoul be ſad, but his death would not reach
my ear. Art thou fallen on thy heath, O ſon of
high Finthormo ! Thou didſt leave me on a
rock, but my ſoul was full of thee. Son of
high Finthormo ! art thou failen on thy heath ?”

{She} roſe pale in her tears. She ſaw the
bloody ſhield of Uthal. She ſaw it in Oſſian's
hand. Her ſteps were diſtracted on the heath.
She flew. She found him. She fell. Her ſoul
came forth in a ſigh. Her hair is ſpread on
his face. My burſting tears deſcend. A tomb
aroſe on the unhappy. My ſong of woe was
heard. `` Reſt, hapleſs children of youth! Reſt
at the noiſe of that moſſy ſtream! The virgins
will ſee your tomb, at the chace, and turn away
their weeping eyes. Your fame will be in ſong.
The voice of the harp will be heard in your
praiſe. The daughters of Selma ſhall hear it:
your renown ſhall be in other lands. Reſt, chil-
dren of youth, at the noiſe of the moſſy ſtream.”
