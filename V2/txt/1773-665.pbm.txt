208 BERRATHON:
--
The night is long, but his eyes are heavy,
Depart, thou ruſtling blaſt.”

``{But} why art thou ſad, ſon of Fingal ? Why
grows the cloud of thy ſoul ? The chiefs of other
times are departed. They have gone without
their fame. The ſons of future years ſhall paſs
away. Another race ſhall ariſe. The people
are like the waves of ocean : like the leaves of
woody Morven, they paſs away in the ruſtling
blaſt, and other leaves lift their green heads on
high.”

{Did} thy beauty laſt, O Ryno@17? Stood the
ſtrength of car-borne Oſcar? Fingal himſelf

departed.

@17 Ryno, the ſon of Fingal, who was killed in Ireland, in
the war againſt Swaran, was remarkable for the beauty of his
perſon, his ſwiftneſs and great exploits. Minv&acirc;ne, the
daughter of Morni, and ſiſter to Gaul, was in love with Ryno.
Her lamentation over her lover follows.

{She} bluſhing ſad, from Morven's rocks, bends over the
darkly-rolling ſea. She ſees the youth in all their arms,
Where, Kyno, where art thou? 

Our dark looks told that he was low ! That pale the hero
flew on clouds! That in the graſs of Morven's hills, his feeble
voice was heard in wind!

And is the ſon of Fingal fallen on Ullin's moſſy plains?
Strong was the arm that vanquiſhed him! Ah me! I am
alone !

Alone I ſhall not be, ye winds! that lift my dark-brown
hair. My ſighs hall not long mix with your ſtream; for I
muſt ſleep with Ryno.
