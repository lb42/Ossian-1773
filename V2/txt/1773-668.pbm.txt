departed. The halls of his fathers forgot his
ſteps. Shalt thou then remain, thou aged bard!
when the mighty have failed ? But my fame ſhall
remain, and grow like the oak of Morven ;
which lifts its broad head to the ſtorm, and
rejoices in the courſe of the wind !

I ſee thee not, with beauty's ſteps, returning from the
chace. The night is round Minv&acirc;ne's love. Dark ſilence
dwells with Ryno.

Where are thy dogs, and where thy bow ? Thy ſhield that
was ſo ſtrong ? Thy ſword like heaven's deſcending fire ? The
bloody ſpear of Ryno ?

I ſee them mixed in thy deep ſhip; I fee them ſtained
with blood. No arms are in thy narrow hall, O darkly-
dwelling Ryno!

When will the morning come, and ſay, `` ariſe, thou king
of ſpears! ariſe, the hunters are abroad. The hinds are near
thee, Ryno!”

Away, thou fair-haired morning, away! the ſlumbering
king hears thee not! The hinds bound over his narrow tomb ;
for death dwells round young Ryno.

But I will tread ſoftly, my king! and ſteal to the bed of
thy repoſe. Minv&acirc;ne will lie in ſilence; nor diſturb the ſlum-
bering Ryno.

The maids ſhall ſeek me; but they ſhall not find me : they
ſhall follow my departure with ſongs. ButIL ſhall not hear
you, O maids: I ſleep with fair-haired Ryno.
