214 A DISSERTATION concerning the
--
much of the marvellous in the origin of every
nation; poſterity being always ready to believe
any thing, however fabulous, that reflects ho-
nour on their anceſtors.

{The} Greeks and Romans were remarkable for
this weakneſs. They ſwallowed the moſt abſurd
fables concerning the high antiquities of their
reſpectve nations. Good hiſtorians, however,
roſe very early amongſt them, and tranſmitted,
with luſtre, their great actions to poſterity. Tt
is to them that they owe that unrivalled fame
they now enjoy, while the great actions of other
nations are involved in fables, or loſt in obſcu-
rity. The Celtic nations afford a ſtriking in-
ſtance of this kind, They, though once the
maſters of Europe from the mouth of the river
Oby @1, in Ruſſia, to Cape Finiſterre, the weſtern
point of Gallicia in Spain, are very little men-
tioned in hiſtory. They truſted their fame to
tradition and the ſongs of their bards, which,
by the viciſſitude of human affairs, are long
ſince loſt. Their ancient language is the only
monument that remains of them ; and the traces
of it being ſound in places ſo widely diſtant from
each other, ſerves only to ſhew the extent of
their ancient power, but throws very little light
on their hiſtory.
