218 A DISSERTATION concerning the
--
joyed long this extraordinary privilege among
the Celtic nations who lay beyond the pale of
the Roman empire. It was in the beginning of
the ſecond century that their power among the
Caledonians begun to decline. The traditions con-
cerning Trathal and Cormac, anceſtors to Fingal,
are full of the particulars of the fall of the Druids:
a fingular fate, it muſt be owned, of prieſts, who
had once eſtabliſhed their ſuperſtition !

{The} continual wars of the Caledonians againſt
the Romans hindered the better ſort from initiat-
ing themſelves, as the cuſtom formerly was, into
the order of the Druids. The precepts of their
religion were confined to a few, and were not
much attended to by a people inured to war.
The Vergobretus, or chief magiſtrate, was
choſen without the concurrence of the hierarchy,
or continued in his office againſt their will.
Continual power ſtrengthened his intereſt among
the tribes, and enabled him to ſend down, as
hereditary to his poſterity, the office he had
only received himſelf by election.

{On} occaſion of a new war againſt the King of
the World, as tradition emphatically calls the
Roman emperor, the Druids, to vindicate the
honour of the order, began to reſume their an-
cient privilege of chuſing the Vergobretus.
