them, came to the grandfather of the celebrated
Fingal, who was then Vergobretus, and com-
manded him, in the name of the whole order,
to lay down his office. Upon his refuſal, a civil
war commenced, which ſoon ended in almoſt
the total extinction of the religious order of the
Druids. A few that remained, retired to the
dark receſſes of their groves, and the caves they
had formerly uſed for their meditations. It is
then we find them in {{the circle of ſtones}}, and un-
heeded by the world. A total diſregard for the
order, and utter abhorrence of the Druidical
rites enſued. Under this cloud of public hate,
all that had any knowlege of the religion of
the Druids became extinct, and the nation fell
into the laft degree of ignorance of their rites
and ceremonies.

{It} is no matter of wonder then, that Fingal
and his ſon Oſſian diſliked the Druids, who were
the declared enemies to their ſucceſſion in the
ſupreme magiſtracy. It is a fingular caſe, it
muſt be allowed, that there are no traces of
religion in the poems aſcribed to Oſſian ; as the
poetical compoſitions of other nations are fo
cloſely connected with their mythology. But gods
are not neceſſary, when the poet has genius. It is
hard to account for it to thoſe who are not made
acquainted with the manner of the old Scottiſh
--
bards.
