222 A DISSERTATION concerning the

guage of the country ſignified {{ſequeſtered perſons}}.
It was with one of the {{Culdees}} that Oſſian, in his
extreme old age, is ſaid to have diſputed con-
cerning the Chriftian religion. This diſpute, they
ſay, is extant, and is couched in verſe, according
to the cuſtom of the times. The extreme igno-
rance on the part of Oſſian, of the Chriſtian te-
nets, ſhews, that that religion had only been
lately introduced, as it is not eafy to conceive,
how one of the firſt rank could be totally unac-
quainted with a religion that had been known
for any time in the country. The diſpute bears
the genuine marks of antiquity. The obſolete
phraſes and expreſſions peculiar to the  times,
prove it to be no forgery. If Oſſian then lived
at the introduction of Chriſtianity, as by all ap-
pearance he did, his epoch will be the latter end
of the third, and beginning of the fourth cen-
tury. Tradition here ſteps in with a kind of
proof.

{The} exploits of Fingal againſt Caracul @9, the
ſon of the {{king of the world}}, are among the firſt
brave actions of his youth. A complete poem,
which relates to this ſubject, is printed in this
collection.
