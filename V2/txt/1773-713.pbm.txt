224 A DISSERTATION concerning the
--
cution under Diocleſian had driven beyond the
pale of the Roman empire.

{In} one of the many lamentations on the death
of Oſcar, a battle which he fought againſt
Caros, king of ſhips, on the banks of the wind-
ing Carun @10, is mentioned among his great
actions. It is more than probable, that the
Caros mentioned here, is the ſame with the
noted uſurper Caraufius, who aſſumed the purple
in the year 287, and ſeizing on Britain, defeated
the emperor Maximian Herculius, in ſeveral
naval engagements, which gives propriety to his
being called {{the King of Ships}}. The {{winding Carun}}
is that ſmall river retaining ſtill the name of
Carron, and runs in the neighbourhood of Agri-
cola's wall, which Carauſius repaired to obſtruct
the incurſions of the Caledonians. Several other
paſſages in traditions allude to the wars of the
Romans ; but the two juſt mentioned clearly fix
the epocha of Fingal to the third century ; and
this account agrees exactly with the Iriſh hiſto-
ries, which place the death of Fingal, the ſon of
Comhal, in the year 283, and that of Oſcar
and their own celebrated Cairbre, in the year
296.

{Some} people may imagine, that the alluſions
to the Roman hiſtory might have been derived
