by tradition, from learned men, more than from
ancient poems. This muſt then have happened at
leaſt three ages ago, as theſe alluſions are men-
tioned often in the compoſitions of thoſe times.

{Every} one knows what a cloud of ignorance
and barbariſm overſpread the north of Europe
three hundred years ago. The minds of men,
addicted to ſuperſtition, contracted a narrowneſs
that deſtroyed genius. Accordingly we find the
compoſitions of thoſe times trivial and puerile to
the laſt degree. But let it be allowed, that,
amidſt all the untoward circumſtances of the
age, a genius might ariſe, it is not eaſy to de-
termine what could induce him to allude to the
Roman times. We find no fact to favour any
deſigns which could be entertained by any man
who lived in the fifteenth century.

{The} ſtrongeſt objection to the antiquity of
the poems now given to the public under the
name of Oſſian, is the improbability of their be-
ing handed down by tradition through ſo many
centuries. Ages of barbariſm ſome will ſay,
could not produce poems abounding with the
diſintereſted and generous ſentiments ſo conſpi-
cuous in the compoſitions of Oſſian; and could
theſe ages produce them, it is impoſſible but they
muſt be loſt, or altogether corrupted in a long
ſucceſſion of barbarous generations.
