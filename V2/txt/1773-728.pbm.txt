bered in a ſtanza, it was almoſt impoſſible to
forget the reſt. The cadences followed in ſo na-
tural a gradation, and the words were ſo adaptcd
to the common turn of the voice, after it is
raiſed to a certain key, that it was almoſt im-
poſſible, from a ſimilarity of ſound, to ſubſtitute
one word for another. This excellence is pecu-
liar to the Celtic tongue, and is perhaps to be
met with in no other language. Nor does this
choice of words clog the ſenſe or weaken the ex-
preſſion. The numerous flections of conſonants,
and variation in declenſion, make the language
very copious.

{The} deſcendants of the Celt&aelig;, who inhabited
Britain and its iſles, were not ſingular in this
method of preſerving the moſt precious monu-
ments of their nation. The ancient laws of the
Greeks were couched in verſe, and handed down
by tradition. The Spartans, through a long
habit, became ſo fond of this cuſtom, that they
would never allow their laws to be committed
to writing. The actions of great men, and the
eulogiums of kings and heroes, were preſerved in
the ſame manner. All the hiſtorical monuments
of the old Germans were comprehended in their
ancient ſongs @11! which were either hymns to
their gods, or elegies in praiſe of their heroes,
