233 A DISSERTATION concerning the
--
people. As they lived in a country only fit for
paſture, they were free from that toil and buſi-
neſs, which engroſs the attention of a commercial
people, Their amuſement conſiſted in hearing
or repeating their ſongs and traditions, and theſe
intirely turned on the antiquity of their nation,
and the exploits of their forefathers. It is no
wonder, therefore, that there are more remains
of antiquity among them, than among any other
people in Europe. Traditions, however, con-
cerning remote periods, are only to be regarded,
in ſo far as they co-incide with cotemporary
writers of undoubted credit and veracity.

{No} writers began their accounts from a more
early period, than the hiſtorians of the Scots
nation. Without records, or even tradition it-
ſelf, they give a long liſt of ancient kings, and
a detail of their tranſactions, with a ſcrupulous
exactneſs. One might naturally ſuppoſe, that,
when they had no authentic annals, they ſhould,
at leaſt, have recourſe to the traditions of their
country, and have reduced them into a regular
ſyſtem of hiſtory. Of both they ſeem to have
been equally deſtitute. Born in the low coun-
try, and ſtrangers to the ancient language of
their nation, they contented themſelves with
copying from one another, and retailing the
ſame fictions, in a new colour and dreſs.
