242 A DISSERTATION concerning the
--
Caledonians, in proceſs of time, became natu-
rally divided into two diſtinct nations, as poſ-
fefſing parts of the country, intirely different in
their nature and ſoil. The weſtern coaſt of
Scotland is hilly and barren ; towards the eaſt the
country is plain, and fit for tillage. The inha-
bitants of the mountains, a roving and uncon-
trouled race of men, lived by feeding of cattle,
and what they killed in hunting. Their employ-
ment did not fix them to one place. They
removed from one heath to another, as ſuited
beſt with their convenience or inclination. They
were not, therefore, improperly called, by their
neighbours, {Scuite}, or {{the wandering nation}} ;
wiuch is evidently the origin of the Roman name
of {{Scoti}}.

{On} the other hand, the Caledonians, who poſ-
ſefſed the eaſt coaſt of Scotland, as the diviſion
of the country was plain and fertile, applied them-
ſelves to agriculture, and raiſing of corn. It was
from this, that the Galic name of the {{Picts}} pro-
ceeded; for they are called, in that language,
{{Cruithnich}}, i. e. {{the wheat or corn-eaters}}. As the
Picts lived in a country ſo different in its nature
from that poſſeſſed by the Scots, ſo their national
characterr ſuffered a material change. Unob-
ſtructed by mountains, or lakes, their commu-
nication with one another was free and frequent.
