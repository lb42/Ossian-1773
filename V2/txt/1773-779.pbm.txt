246 A DISSERTATION concerning the
--
habitants of Ireland, that eyery unbiaſſed per-
ſon will confeſs them more probable, than the
legends handed down, by tradition, in that
country. It appears, that, in the days of Tra-
thal, grandfather to Fingal, Ireland was poſſeſſed
by two nations; the {{Firbolg}} or {{Belg&aelig;}} of Britain,
who inhabited the ſouth, and the Ca&euml;l, who
paſſed over from Caledonia and the Hebrides to
Ulfter. The two nations, as is uſual among an
unpoliſhed and lately ſettled people, were divided
into ſmall dynaſties, ſubject to petty kings, or
chiefs, independent of one another. In this
ſituation, it is probable, they continued long,
without any material revolution in the ſtate of
the iſland, until Crothar, Lord of Atha, a coun-
try in Connaught, the moſt potent chief of the
{{Firbolg}}, carried away Conlama, the daughter
of Cathmin, a chief of the Ca&euml;l, who poſſeſſed
Ulſter.

{Conlama} had been betrothed ſome time
before to Turloch, a chief of their own nation.
Turloch reſented the affront offered him by Cro-
thar, made an irruption into Connaught, and
killed Cormul, the brother of Crothar, who
came to oppoſe his progreſs. Crothar himſelf
then took arms, and either killed or expelled
Turloch. The war, upon this, became general,
between the two nations: and the Ca&euml;l were
