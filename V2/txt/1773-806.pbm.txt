latter were entirely relegated to inhabitants of
the mountains, who were ſtill unmixed with
ſtrangers.

{It} was after the acceſſion of territory which
the Scots received, upon the retreat of the Ro-
mans from Britain, that the inhabitants of the
Highlands were divided into clans. The king,
when he kept his court in the mountains, was
conſidered, by the whole nation, as the chief of
their blood. Their ſmall number, as well as the
preſence of their prince, prevented thoſe diviſions,
which, afterwards, ſprung forth into ſo many
ſeparate tribes. When the ſeat of government
was removed to the ſouth, thoſe who remained
in the Highlands were, of courſe, neglected.
They naturally formed themſelves into ſmall fo-
cieties, independent of one another. Each ſoci-
ety had it's own {{regulus}}, who either was, or in
the ſucceſſion of a few generations, was regarded
as chief of their blood. The nature of the
country favoured an inſtitution of this ſort. A
few valleys, divided from one another by exten-
ſive heaths and impaſſible mountains, form the
face of the Highlands. In theſe valleys the chiefs
fixed their reſidence. Round them, and almoſt
within ſight of their dwellings, were  the habita-
tions of their relations and dependents.
