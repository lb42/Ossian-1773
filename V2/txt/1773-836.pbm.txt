POEMS of OSSIAN. 26s

ſitions; but, unluckily for the antiquities of
Ireland, they appear to be the work of a very
modern period. Every ſtanza, nay almoſt every
line, affords ſtriking proofs, that they cannot
be three centuries old. Their alluſions to the
manners and cuſtoms of the fifteenth century, are
ſo many, that it is matter of wonder to me, how
any one could dream of their antiquity. They
are entirely writ in that romantic taſte, which
prevailed two ages ago. Giants, enchanted
caſtles, dwarfs, palfreys, witches and magicians
form the whole circle of the poet's invention.
The celebrated {{Fion}} could ſcarcely move from
one hillock to another, without encountering a
giant, or being entangled in the circles of a
magician. Witches, on broomſticks, were con-
tinually hovering round him, like crows; and
he had freed enchanted virgins in every valley
in Ireland. In ſhort, {{Fion}}, great as he was,
paſſed a diſagreeable life. Not only had he to
engage all the miſchiefs in his own country,
foreign armies invaded him, aſſiſted by magi-
cians and witches, and headed by Kings, as tall
as the main-maſt of a firſt rate. It muſt be
owned, however, that {{Fion}} was not inferior to
them in height.
