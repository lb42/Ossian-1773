2750 A DISSERTATION concerning the
--
the {{Iriſh Oſſian}} diſcovers the age in which he lived,
by an unlucky anachroniſm. After deſcribing
the total route of Erragon, he very gravely
concludes with this remarkable anecdote, that
none of the foe eſcaped, but a few, who were
permitted to go on a pilgrimage to the {{Holy Land}}.
This circumſtance fixes the date of the compo-
fition of the piece ſome centuries after the famous
croiſade; for, it is evident, that the poet thought
the time of the croiſade ſo ancient, that he con-
ſounds it with the age of Fingal. Erragon, in
the courſe of this poem, is often called,

Riogh {{Lochlin}} an do ſhloigh,\
{{King of Denmark of two nations}}\

which alludes to the union of the kingdoms of
Norway and Denmark, a circumſtance which
happened under Margaret de Waldemar, in the
cloſe of the fourteenth age. Modern, however,
as this pretended Oſſian was, it is certain, he
lived before the Iriſh had dreamed of appropri-
ating {{Fion}}, or {{Fingal}}, to themſelves. He con-
cludes the poem, with this reflection.
