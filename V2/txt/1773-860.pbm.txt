POEMS of OSSIAN: 213
--
Tara}}, in the county of Meath. This ſevere title
of the {{redoubtable Cuthullin}}, the moſt renowned of 
Iriſh champions, proceeded from the poet's ig-
norance of etymology. {Cu}, {{voice}}, or com-
mander, ſignifies alſo a {{dog}}. The poet choſe
the laſt, as the moſt noble appellation for his
hero.

{The} ſubject of the poem is the ſame with that
of the epic poem of Fingal. {{Caribh Mac-Starn}}
is the ſame with Oſſian's Swaran, the ſon of
Starno. His ſingle combats with, and his vic-
tory over all the heroes of Ireland, excepting
the {{celebrated dog of Tara}}, i. e. Cuthullin, afford
matter for two hundred lines of tolerable poetry.
{{Caribh}}'s progreſs in ſearch of Cuthullin, and his
intrigue with the gigantic Emir-bragal, that
hero's wife, enables the poet to extend his piece
to four hundred lines. This author, it is true,
makes Cuthullin a native of Ireland ; the gigan-
tic Emir-bragal he calls the {{guiding ſtar of the
women of Ireland}}. The property of this enor-
mous lady I ſhall not diſpute with him, or any
other. But, as he ſpeaks with great tenderneſs
of the {{daughters of the convent}}, and throws out
ſome hints againſt the Englith nation, it is pro-
bable he lived in too modern a period to be
intimately acquainted with the genealogy of Cu-
thullin.
