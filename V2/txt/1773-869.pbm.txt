2356 A DISSERTATION concerning 'the

Siol {Erin} na gorm l&aacute;nn,\
{{The ſons of}} {Erin} {{of blue ſteel}}.\

Neither ſhall I much diſpute the matter with
him : He has my conſent alſo to appropriate to
Ireland the celebrated Ton-iofal. I ſhall only
ſay, that they are different perſons from thoſe
of the ſame name, in the Scotch poems ; and
that, though the ſtupendous valour of the firſt
is ſo remarkable, they have not been equally
lucky with the latter, in their poet. It is ſome-
what extraordinary, that {{Fion}}, who lived ſome
ages before St. Patrick, ſwears like a very good
chriſtian :

Air an Dia do chum gach {{caſe}}.\
{{By God, who ſhaped every caſe}}.\

It is worthy of being remarked, that, in the line
quoted, Oſſian, who lived in St. Patrick's days,
ſeems to have underſtood ſomething of the Eng-
liſh, a language not then ſubſiſting. A perſon,
more ſanguine for the honour of his country
than I am, might argue, from this circumſtance,
that this pretendedly Iriſh Ofſian was a native of
Scotland ; for my countrymen are univerſally
allowed to have an excluſive right to the ſecond--
ſight.
