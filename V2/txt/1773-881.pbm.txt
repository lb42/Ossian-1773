writers, ſtrangers to the antient language of
their country, preſerved only from falling to the
ground, ſo improbable a ſtory.

{This} ſubject, perhaps, is purſued further than
it deſerves; but a diſcuſſion of the pretenſions
of Ireland, was become in ſome meaſure neceſ-
ſary. If the Iriſh poems, concerning the {{Fiona}},
ſhould appear ridiculous, it is but juſtice to ob-
ferve, that they are ſcarcely more ſo than the
poems of other nations, at that period. On
other ſubjects, the bards of Ireland have diſ-
played a genius for poetry. It was, alone, in
matters of antiquity, that they were monſtrous
in their fables. Their love-ſonnets, and their
elegies on the death of perſons worthy or re-
nowned, abound with ſimplicity, and a wild
harmony of numbers. They become more than
an atonement for their errors, in every other
ſpecies of poetry. But the beauty of theſe pieces,
depends ſo much on a certain {{curioſa felicitas}} of
expreſſion in the original, that they muſt appear
much to diſadvantage in another language.
