 <div><head>ARGUMENT.</head><p> Conlath was the youngeſt of Morni's ſons, and brother to the celebrated Gaul. He was in love with Cuthóna the daughter of Rumar, when Toſcar the ſon of Kinfena, accompanied by Fercuth his friend, arrived, from Ireland, at Mora, where Conlath dwelt. He was hoſpitably received, and according to the cuſtom of the times, feaſted, three days, with Conlath. On the fourth he ſet ſail, and coaſting the <hi>iſland of waves</hi>, one of the Hebrides, he ſaw Cuthona hunting, fell in love with her, and carried her away, by force, in his ſhip. He was forced, by ſtreſs of weather, into I-thona a deſart iſle. In the mean-time Conlath, hearing of the rape, ſailed after him, and ſound him on the point of ſailing for the coaſt of Ireland. They fought; and they and their followers fell by mutual wounds. Cuthona did not long ſurvive: for ſhe died of grief the third day after. Fingal, hearing of their unfortunate death, ſent Stormal the ſon of Moran to bury them, but forgot to ſend a bard to ſing the funeral ſong over their tombs. The ghoſt of Conlath comes, long after, to Oſſian, to intreat him to tranſmit, to poſterity, his and Cuthona's fame. For it was the opinion of the times, that the ſouls of the deceaſed were not happy, till their elegies were compoſed by a bard. </p></div> <!--  -->

Who art thou, ſon of night ? The children of the feeble are aſleep. The midnight wind is in my hall. Perhaps it is the ſhield of Fingal that ecchoes to the blaſt. It hangs in Oſſian's hall. He feels it ſometimes with his hands. Yes! I hear thee, my friend ! Long has thy voice been abſent from mine ear ! What brings thee, on thy cloud, to Oſſian, ſon of generous Morni? Are the friends of the aged near thee? Where is Oſcar, ſon of fame? He was often near thee, O Conlath, when the ſound of battle aroſe. <!--  -->
