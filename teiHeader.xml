   <!-- Some, but not all, of the following principles, taken from other Ossian Online documents, have been applied -->
   <!--  <normalization method="silent">
    <p>Spacing between words and punctuation marks has been regularised to zero spaces.
     Spacing following full stops has been regularised to one space.</p>
   </normalization>
   <normalization method="silent">
    <p>The long s in the source text has been regularised to the modern short s.</p>
   </normalization>-->
   <normalization>
    <p>Spacing between punctuation marks and words has been retained, except for double quotes, and
     foot note sigla. Linebreaks in the source have been removed. Long S and other unusual
     characters preserved where a Unicode representation exists.</p>
    <p>Decorative and functional features of the source copies have not been encoded and reproduced.
     These include printers' ornaments and rules, running titles, catchwords, signature marks, and
     press figures.</p>
    <p>Half titles, present in the NYPL copy but not the NLS copy, have been retained.</p>
   </normalization>
   <!-- <normalization method="silent">
    <p>Common eighteenth-century ligatures are transcribed as their constituent individual
     letters. The exceptions to this are the &#xe6; and &#x153; ligatures (in upper- and
     lower-case) which are used in Latin and foreign words (and English words deriving from
     same).</p>
   </normalization>-->
   <hyphenation eol="some">
    <p>End-of-line hyphenation silently removed where appropriate(not in cases where the hyphenation
     would be preserved if occuring mid-line).</p>
    <p>Where a hyphenated word straddles a page-break in the source text, the complete word is
     encoded before the page-break in the XML file.</p>
   </hyphenation>
   <quotation marks="some">
    <p>Quotation marks are retained in the text
     <!--with one exception: the convention of
     repeating opening quotation marks at the beginning of each new typographic line in
     passages that span more than one typographic line is not preserved. In these instances,
     only the opening and closing quotation marks are preserved.-->
